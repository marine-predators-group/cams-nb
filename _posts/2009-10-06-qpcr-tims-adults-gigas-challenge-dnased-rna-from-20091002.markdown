Performed qPCR using q18s primers on DNased RNA (1:100 dilution to match final concentration of template after making cDNA). [qPCR set up and plate layout are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091005-01.jpg).

gDNA dilutions were used as positive controls. gDNA = BB11 (0.49ug/uL) from [20090519](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090519). Used 5uL of 1:10, 1:100 and 1:000 dilutions.

Results: gDNA dilutions look good. However, some samples are definitely coming up before the 40 cycle mark. Will re-DNase treat these.
