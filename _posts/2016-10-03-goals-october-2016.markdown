[Last month's goals](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2016/09/06/goals-september-2016.html), as it turns out, were way too ambitious. This month's goal will be to get the Oly GBS data analysis fully completed (currently have individuals data, but need summary of the three populations data). I'll also get the data sets and data analysis prepared/placed in satisfactory repositories in preparation for publication in [Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/about).
