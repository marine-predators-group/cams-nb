RNA was isolated in 1mL TriReagent, according to protocol. Samples were resuspended in 50uL 0.1% DEPC-H2O and spec'd. RNA was stored @ -80C in "[Shellfish RNA Box #4](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?hl=en&key=pwrSWt05L-jZMgZvrRwC8QA&hl=en#gid=3)".

Overall, all RNA looks very good (based on 260/280 and 260/230 values).
