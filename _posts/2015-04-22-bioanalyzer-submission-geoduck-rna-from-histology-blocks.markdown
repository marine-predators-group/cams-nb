Submitted 3μL (~75ng) of RNA from each of [the two gonad samples isolated from foot tissue embedded in paraffin histology blocks 20150408](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/04/08/rna-isolation-geoduck-foot-in-paraffin-histology-blocks.html) (to assess quality of RNA) to Jesse Tsai at [University of Washington Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Science Functional Genomics Laboratory](https://depts.washington.edu/ceeh/members/core-services.html):




    
  * Geoduck Block 34

    
  * Geoduck Block 42



Jesse will determine if the samples should be run on the RNA Pico or the RNA Nano chips.
