We received a hard drive from BGI on 20160223 (while I was out on paternity leave) containing the _Ostrea lurida_ GBS data.

Briefly, three sets (i.e. populations) of [Olympia oyster tissue was collected from oysters raised in Oyster Bay](2015/11/30/sample-submission-oly-oyster-bay-tissues-for-gbs.html) and were sent to BGI for DNA extraction and GBS. A total of 23 individuals from each of the following three populations were sequenced (a grand total of 96 samples):




    
  * 1HL - (Hood Canal, Long Spit)

    
  * 1NF - (North Sound, Fidalgo Bay)

    
  * 1SN - (South Sound, Oyster Bay)



An overview of this project can be viewed on our [GitHub Olympia oyster wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-olympia.oyster-genomic/wiki/Genotype-by-sequencing-November-2015).

Data was copied from the HDD to the following location on Owl (our server): [http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/)

The data was generated from paired-end Illumina sequencing, so there are two FASTQ files for each individual.

The files were analyzed to create a MD5 checksum, perform read counts, and create a [readme (markdown format) file](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/readme.md). This was performed in a Jupyter/iPython notebook (see below).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The directory where this data is housed was renamed AFTER the Jupyter notebook was run. As such, the directory listed above will not be seen in the Jupyter notebook.
