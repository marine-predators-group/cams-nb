Yep, BGI still needs more gDNA for the Olympia oyster genome sequencing project. Samples have been quantified via dye-based fluorescence, as opposed to the NanoDrop, so our quantities should be more accurate and in-line with what BGI will also find.

Submitted three separate isolations, just in case the quality of one was unacceptable, I didn't want to pool the samples and have that one bad apple ruin the entire batch.

In total, submitted ~31μg.

Samples were shipped on dry ice with the appropriate paperwork required by BGI (sample declaration letter).
