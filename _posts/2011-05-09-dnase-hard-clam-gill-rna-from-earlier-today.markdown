DNased 5ug of RNA from each sample with Ambion's Turbo DNA-free Kit, according to the manufacturer's rigorous protocol. Samples were spec'd and stored @ -80C in the "Hard Clam V.t. Experiment RNA" box.

Results:

Due to lack of a positive control (and lack of primers known to amplify gDNA), these DNased RNA samples will NOT be checked to verify elimination of gDNA carryover at this time. Will proceed with making cDNA for qPCR anyway.
