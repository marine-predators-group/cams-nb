Performed colony PCRs on the 4 sets of cloning reactions that were performed yesterday using the M13F/R vector primers. Colonies were picked, restreaked on a fresh LB Kan50 plates (made 20110726 by SJW) and PCR'd. [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110726-01.jpg). Selected 8 white colonies from each cloning reaction for PCR. Restreaked plate was incubated @ 37C O/N.

Cycling Params:




    
  * 95C - 10m



40cycles of:


    
  * 95C - 10s

    
  * 55C - 10s

    
  * 72C - 3m



Results:

Hyperladder I is used as the ladder in both gels.

Cloning results look great (except Colony #1 in the 5' Top Band didn't produce a product). Will select a re-streaked colony from each set and inoculate liquid culture for mini prep and subsequent sequencing.
