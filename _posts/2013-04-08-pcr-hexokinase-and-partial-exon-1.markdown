Performed PCR using newly designed primers to amplify the C. gigas hexokinase "promoter" (-2059bp from start) along with a portion of the first exon.

Primers used were Cg_Hk_Prom_pBAD_-2059 (SRID: 1518) and Cg_HK_Exon1_R (SRID: 1520).

Template used was C.gigas gDNA BB15 (from 20090519; 0.4216ug/uL). Master mix calcs are here. Cycling params are the same used on 20130227.

Samples were run in duplicate.

Results:

Lane 1: Hyperladder II (Bioline)

Lanes 2-3: C.gigas gDNA

Lanes 4-5: NTCs

We see a band of >2000bp (that's the maximum on the molecular weight marker). The bands from each replicate were excised, purified using Ultrafree-DA columns (Millipore) and stored at 4C.
