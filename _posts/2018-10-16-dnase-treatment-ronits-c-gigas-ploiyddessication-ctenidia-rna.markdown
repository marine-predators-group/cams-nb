After [quantifying Ronit's RNA earlier today](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/10/16/rna-quantification-ronits-c-gigas-ploidydessication-rna/), I DNased them using the Turbo DNA-free Kit (Ambion), according to the [manufacturer's standard protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Ambion_Turbo_DNA_Free.pdf).

Used 1000ng of RNA in a 50uL reaction in a 0.5mL thin-walled snap cap tube. Samples were mixed by finger flicking and then incubated 30mins @ 37oC in a PTC-200 thermal cylcer (MJ Research), without a heated lid.

DNase inactivation was performed (0.1 volumes of inactivation reagent; 5uL), pelleted, and supe transferred to new 1.7mL snap cap tube.

Samples were stored on ice in preparation for qPCR to test for residual gDNA.

DNase calculations are here:

Samples will be permanently stored here (Google Sheet):
