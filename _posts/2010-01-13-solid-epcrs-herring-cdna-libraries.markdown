### Herring fragmented cDNA library: 4LHTOG09



Using 1.5pM of starting template, based on success of the 3LHSITK09 bead prep (see 20100108).

Processed herring fragmented cDNA library 4LHTOG09 (20.1.ng/uL) according to the ABI "Templated Bead Preparation Guide" following the "full-scale" protocol. Made a 1:100 dilution (1uL library, 99uL 1x Low TE) = 201pg/uL. Mixed 89.6uL of this diluted sample with 10.4uL 1x Low TE to get a final concentration of 180pg/uL (1.5pM, according to ABI protocol). Oil phase used was previously prepared by Jesse (Seeb lab) 1/11/2010. This oil phase is stable for 2 months @ 4C.

ePCR was run. The plate will be stored @ 4C until the two remaining libraries have been through ePCR. Then, all three libraries will be processed simulatneously.

### Herring fragmented cDNA library: 6LHPWS09



Using 1.5pM of starting template, based on success of the 3LHSITK09 bead prep (see 20100108).

Processed herring fragmented cDNA library 6LHPWS09 (51.4.ng/uL) according to the ABI "Templated Bead Preparation Guide" following the "full-scale" protocol. Made a 1:100 dilution (1uL library, 99uL 1x Low TE) = 541pg/uL. Mixed 35uL of this diluted sample with 65uL 1x Low TE to get a final concentration of 180pg/uL (1.5pM, according to ABI protocol). Oil phase used was previously prepared by Jesse (Seeb lab) 1/11/2010. This oil phase is stable for 2 months @ 4C.

ePCR was run. The plate will be stored @ 4C until the two remaining libraries have been through ePCR. Then, all three libraries will be processed simultaneously.
