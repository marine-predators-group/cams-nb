Continuing with the RAD-seq library prep. [Following the Meyer Lab 2bRAD protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/External_Protocols/2bRAD_11Aug2015.pdf).

Prior to generating full-blown libraries, we needed to run a “test-scale” PCR to identify the minimum number of cycles needed to produce the intended product size (166bp).

I ran PCR reactions on a subset (Sample #: 2, 3, 17, & 30) of the 10 samples that [I performed adaptor ligations on 20151029](2015/10/29/adaptor-ligation-oly-alfi-digested-gdna-for-rad-seq-3.html).

PCR reactions were set up on ice in 0.5mL PCR tubes.

Combined 12μL of master mix with 8μL of the ligation reaction from earlier today.

Cycling was performed on a PTC-200 (MJ Research) with a heated lid:

We’re following the “1/4 reduced representation” aspect of the protocol. As such, 5μL of each reaction was pulled immediately after the extension (72C – machine was paused) of cycles 12, 17, 22, & 27 in order to determine the ideal number of cycles to use. Also ran the ligation reactions (labeled “Ligations” on the gel below) of the samples as a pre-PCR comparison. Treated them the same as the PCR reactions: mixed 8μL of the ligation with 12μL of H2O, used 5μL of that mix to load on gel.

These samples were run on a 1x modified TAE 1.2% agarose gel (w/EtBr).

Green arrow indicates the expected migration of our target band size of 166bp.[/caption]

Looks like cycle 17 is the minimum cycle number with which we begin to see a consistent ~166bp band. Will continue on with the "prep-scale" PCR using 17 cycles.
