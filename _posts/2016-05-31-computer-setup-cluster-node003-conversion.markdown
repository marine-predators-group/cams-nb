Here's an overview of some of the struggles getting node003 converted/upgraded to function as an independent computer (as opposed to a slave node in the Apple computer cluster).




    
  * 6TB HDD

    
  * Only 2.2TB recognized when connected to Hummingbird via Firewire - internet suggests that is max for Xserve; USB might recognize full drive) - Hummingbird is a converted Xserve running Mavericks

    
  * Reformatted on different Mac and full drive size recognized

    
  * Connected to Hummingbird (via USB) and full 6TB recognized

    
  * Connected to Mac Mini to install OS X

    
  * Tried installing OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion) via CMD+r at boot, but failed partway through installation

    
  * Tried and couldn't reformat drive through CMD+r at boot with Disk Utility

    
  * Broken partition tables identified on Linux, used GParted to establish partition table, back to Mac Mini and OS X (Mountain Lion) install worked

    
  * Upgraded to OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan)

    
  * Inserted drive to Mac cluster node003 - wouldn't boot all the way - Apple icon, progress bar > Do Not Enter symbol

    
  * Removed drive, put original back in, connected 6TB HDD via USB, but booting from USB not an option (when booting and holding Option key)

    
  * Probably due to node003 being part of cluster - reformatted original node003 drive with clean install of OS X Server.

    
  * Booting from USB now an option and worked with 6TB HDD!

    
  * Put 6TB HDD w/El Capitan in internal sled and won't boot! Apple icon, progress bar > Do Not Enter symbol

    
  * Installed OS X 10.11.5 (El Capitan) on old 1TB drive and inserted into node003 - worked perfectly!

    
  * Will just use 1TB boot drive and figure out another use for 6TB HDD

    
  * Renamed node003 to roadrunner

    
  * Current plan is to upgrade from 12GB to 48GB of RAM and then automate moving data off this drive to long-term storage on Owl (Synology server).
