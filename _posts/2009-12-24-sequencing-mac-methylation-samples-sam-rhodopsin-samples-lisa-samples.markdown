Samples were submitted for sequencing. Mac prepped all Roberts Lab samples excluding the Opsin VMC gel slice 2 from 20091217-02. The gel slice was purified with Millipore spin columns. The sample was diluted 1:1 with H2O and submitted for sequencing, one time from each direction using the Sep_Op_Fw2/Rv2 primers.
