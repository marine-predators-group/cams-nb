Steven recently saw an announcement that Microsoft R Open now handles multi-threaded processing (default R does not), so we were interested in trying it out. I installed MLR/MRO on Emu/Roadrunner (Apple Xserve; Ubuntu 16.04). [Followed the Microsoft installation directions for Ubuntu](httpss://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning-server/install/machine-learning-server-linux-install). In retrospect, I think I could've just installed MRO, but this gets the job done as well and won't hurt anything.

I've set both Emu & Roadrunner R Studio Server to use this installation of R by changing the `/etc/restudio/rserver.conf` file to the following:


    
    <code>
    # Server Configuration File
    
    # Use Microsoft R Open instead of default R version.
    # Comment out and restart R Studio Server (sudo rstudio-server restart)
    # to restore default R version.
    
    rsession-which-r=/opt/microsoft/ropen/3.4.3/lib64/R/bin/R
    </code>



I have confirmed that R Studio Server on both machines starts up and is using MRO instead of the default version of R.
