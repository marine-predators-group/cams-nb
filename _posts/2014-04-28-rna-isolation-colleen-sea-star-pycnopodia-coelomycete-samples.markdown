Isolated RNA from the following samples (provided by Colleen Burge):




    
  * Bio 26 (a LARGE amount of tissue/debris in this sample!)

    
  * CF 2

    
  * CF 3

    
  * CF 17

    
  * CF 34

    
  * CF 35

    
  * CF 70

    
  * CF 71



Samples were initially flash frozen and then stored @ -80C (no preservatives used). No visible cells/tissue in all samples, except Bio 26. Samples were homogenized in 1mL TriReagent. Used the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (ZymoResearch) according to the manufacturer's protocol (including on-column DNase I procedure) for the remainder of the isolation. Eluted with 50uL of 0.1%DEPC-treated H2O and spec'd on NanoDrop1000.

Samples were stored in [Shellfish RNA Box #5](httpss://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWpaTWdadnJSd0M4UUE&usp=sharing).

Results:

Samples CF 3 and CF 17 likely have insufficient total RNA for sequencing at Cornell (200ng minimum required).

_UPDATE 20140514_ - CF2, CF34, CF35, CF70, CF71 sent to Cornell for Illumina RNA-seq on 20140514
