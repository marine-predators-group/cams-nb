Yesterday's qPCR indicated that all of the RNA still contained gDNA contamination. So, took 10ug of RNA from BB #1-10 and DH#1-10 (calcs/workup [BB](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090508-01.jpg) and [DH](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090508-02.jpg)) and brought the volumes up to 50uL with 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Processed the samples according to Ambion Tubrbo DNA-free protocol. Will proceed with qPCR immediately.
