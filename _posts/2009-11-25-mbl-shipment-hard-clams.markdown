Received hard clams from Scott Lindell today. Two bags. One group (4 live clams, 1 empty shell) labelled as "FL" and another group (9 live clams) labelled as "BX." Clams were transferred to separate plastic shoebox containers with sea water and sand. They were stored at 15C until ready for experiment.
