Isolated DNA from 24 2SN ctenidia samples from [Friday's sampling](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/10/30/oyster-sampling-oly-fidalgo-2sn-2hl-2nf-reciprocal-transplants-final-samplings/) (#32 - 55). Samples were thawed at RT.

DNA was isolated using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit (Omega BioTek) according to [the manufacturer’s protocol](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Omega_Mollusc-DNA-Kit-Combo-May-2013-D3373.pdf) with the following changes:




    
  * Samples were incubated @ 60C for only 1hr, per Steven's recommendation (an attempt to prevent degradation)

    
  * No optional steps were performed

    
  * Used 300μL of MBL Buffer for all samples (this was more than the recovered volume of aqueous phase from each sample)

    
  * Single elution of 50μL



Samples were stored @ -20C in: Oly gDNA Oly Reciprocal Transplant Final Sampling Box #1.

Some notes:


    
  * Total time (including 1hr incubation): 4.5hrs.

    
  * Short incubation time did not completely digest samples

    
  * Partial tissue digestions led to difficulties in recovering entire aqueous phase, post chloroform treatment
