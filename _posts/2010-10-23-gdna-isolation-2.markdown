Isolated gDNA from crab (unknown species), starfish exposed to RoundUp (unknown species) and gray whale blubber using Qiagen's DNEasy Kit, according to manufacturer's protocol. Tissue was incubated at 55C with Proteinase K for 1hr. gDNA was eluted with 100uL of Buffer AE and spec'd.

Gray whale sample has virtually no DNA. Will try to precipitate the whale gDNA in order to obtain a more concentrated sample. The other two samples look good, with good yields and good OD260/280 ratios.
