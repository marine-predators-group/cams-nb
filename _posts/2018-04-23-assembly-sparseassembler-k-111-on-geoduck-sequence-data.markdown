Continuing to try to find the best kmer setting to work with SparseAssemlber after [the last attempt failed due to a kmer size that was too large](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/04/22/assembly-sparseassembler-k-131-on-geoduck-sequence-data/) (k 131; which happens to be outside the max kmer size [127] for SparseAssembler), I re-ran SparseAssembler with an arbitrarily selected kmer size < 131 (picked k 111).

The job was run on our Mox HPC node.

This failed with the following error message:

`Error! K-mer size too large!`

Well, this is disappointing. Not entirely sure why this is the case, as it's below the max kmer setting for SparseAssembler. However, I'm not terribly surprised, as [this happened previously (only using NovaSeq data) with a kmer setting of 117](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/03/08/assembly-geoduck-novaseq-using-sparseassembler-failed/).

I've posted [an issue on the kmergenie GitHub page](https://github.com/yechengxi/SparseAssembler/issues/4#issuecomment-383749554); we'll see what happens.
