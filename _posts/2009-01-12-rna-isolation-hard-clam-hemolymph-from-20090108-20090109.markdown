1mL of TriReagent was used to isolate RNA from 3 combined tubes of hemolymph. This resulted in 10 total RNA preps. Pellets were resuspended in 100uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O and pooled into a single tube and NanoDropped.

Results: RNA solution looked very cloudy and contains a fair amount of insoluble "stuff". 260/280 ratios also looked bad. Will precipitate O/N according to Ambion PolyA Purist Kit before isolating mRNA tomorrow.
