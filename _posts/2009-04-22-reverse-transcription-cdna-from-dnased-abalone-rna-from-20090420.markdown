[Prepared cDNA using an equal amount of RNA from all samples (442.6ng)](http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzcHdyU1d0MDVMLWphMFdTOHUwVHFqWnc&hl=en). This amount was based on using the maximum allowable volume of RNA for the RT rxn AND the sample with the lowest [RNA] (08:3-20; 24.59ng/uL). cDNA was prepared according to the [Promega MMLV RT recommendations](http://genefish.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Product%20Information%20Sheets/Promega%20-%20MMLV%20RT.pdf). [Here is the work up for the cDNA rxns](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090422-01.jpg). cDNA was stored @ -20C.
