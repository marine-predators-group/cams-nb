Results were received on 20090210. Comment from CAT staff member was that it looked "pretty good." Here are links to [the gel (look for SR01)](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/RNA%20Spec%20Readings/2100%20expert_EukaryoteTotal%20RNA%20Nano_DE11400776_2009-02-09_12-37-49_GEL.bmp), the [electoropherogram of SR01](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/RNA%20Spec%20Readings/2100%20expert_EukaryoteTotal%20RNA%20Nano_DE11400776_2009-02-09_12-37-49_EGRAM_Sample9.bmp), and the [EGRAM of the ladder](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/RNA%20Spec%20Readings/2100%20expert_EukaryoteTotal%20RNA%20Nano_DE11400776_2009-02-09_12-37-49_EGRAM_Ladder.bmp).
