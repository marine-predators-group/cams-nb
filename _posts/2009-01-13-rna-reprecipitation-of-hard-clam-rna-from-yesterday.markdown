Because of the relatively large size of the pellets vs. the amount of RNA, I think another round of precipitation would be best to help remove additional residual salt carryover. Will precipitate O/N according to Ambion PolyA Purist protocol. RNA pellets were resuspended in 250uL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O and precipitated O/N @ -20C.

NOTE: Upon adding 100% EtOH to sample, the solution turned very cloudy and a white precipitate immediately formed inside the tube. I do not think this precipitate is RNA. Tomorrow, before spinning the tube, I will transfer the supe to a fresh tube and process both tubes simultaneously. Hopefully this will remove/eliminate most of the excess salt or whatever seems to be forming the pellet.
