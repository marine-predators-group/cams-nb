Yesterday, our [Xsede Startup Application (Google Doc)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4ukb4M3ZY73KaBsYjcmF35pAE2pEGH9AevdXAxCONI/edit?usp=sharing) got approval for 100,000 Service Units (SUs) and 1TB of disk space on Xsede/Atmosphere/Jetstream (or, whatever it's actually called!). The approval happened within an hour of submitting the application!

Here's a copy of the approval notice:

  Review #0 - Excellent

  Assessment and Summary:
  Maker is a well-known and fitting workflow for Jetstream. This should be a good use of resources.

  Appropriateness of Methodology:

  _After_ each user on the allocation has logged in, the PI will need to open a ticket via help@xsede.org and request the quota be set per the allocation to 1TB. Please provide the XSEDE portal ID of each user.

  Appropriateness of Computational Research Plan:

  We request that any publications stemming from work done using Jetstream cite us - https://jetstream-cloud.org/research/citing-jetstream.php

We had a tremendous amount of help from [Upendra Devisetty at CyVerse](https://www.cyverse.org/upendra-devisetty) in getting the [Xsede](https://portal.xsede.org) Startup Application written, as well as running WQ-MAKER on Xsede/Atmosphere/Jetstream (or, whatever it's called!).



* * *



Now, on to how I got the run going...

I initiated the Olympia oyster genome annotation using a [WQ-MAKER instance (MAKER 2.31.9 with CCTools v3.1) on Jetstream](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/492):

![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wq-maker_04.png)



* * *



I followed the excellent step-by-step directions here:





  * [MAKER 2.31.9 Jetstream Tutorial](https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/TUT/MAKER+2.31.9+with+CCTOOLS+Jetstream+Tutorial)



The "MASTER" machine was a "m1.xlarge" machine (i.e. CPU: 24, Mem: 60 GB, Disk: 60 GB).

I attached a 1TB volume to the MASTER machine.

I set up the run using 21 "WORKER" machines. Twenty WORKERS were "m1.large" machines (i.e. CPU: 10, Mem: 30 GB, Disk: 60 GB). The remaining WORKER was set at "m1.xlarge" (i.e. CPU: 24, Mem: 60 GB, Disk: 60 GB) to use up the rest of our allocated memory.

![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wq-maker_01.png)



* * *



MASTER machine was initialized with the following command:



    <code>nohup wq_maker -contigs-per-split 1 -cores 1 -memory 2048 -disk 4096 -N wq_maker_oly${USER} -d all -o master.dbg -debug_size_limit=0 -stats test_out_stats.txt > log_file.txt 2>&1 &</code>



Each WORKER was started with the following command:



    <code>nohup work_queue_worker -N wq_maker_oly${USER} --cores all --debug-rotate-max=0 -d all -o worker.dbg > log_file_2.txt 2>&1 &</code>



When starting each WORKER, an error message was generated, but this doesn't seem to have any impact on the ability of the program to run:

![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wq-maker_worker_error.png)



* * *



I checked on the status of the run and you can see that there are 22 WORKERS and 15,568 files "WAITING". BUT, there are 159,429 contigs in our genome FastA!

Why don't these match??!!

This is because WQ-MAKER splits the genome FastA into smaller FastA files containg only 10 sequences each. This is why we see 10-fold fewer files being processed than sequences in our genome file.

![](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180807_wq-maker_03.png)

Here is the rest of the nitty gritty details:



##### Genome file:







  * [Olurida_v081.fa](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/halfshell/genomic-databank/Olurida_v081.fa)



    * See our [Genomic Resources GtiHub wiki for deets](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/Genomic-Resources#ostrea-lurida)







##### Transcriptome file:







  * [Olurida_transcriptome_v3.fasta](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/cnidarian/Olurida_transcriptome_v3.fasta)





##### Proteome files (NCBI):



The two FastA files below were concatenated into a single FastA file (`gigas_virginica_ncbi_proteomes.fasta`) for use in WQ-MAKER.





  * _Crassostrea gigas_



    * [GCA_000297895.1_oyster_v9_protein.faa.gz](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/297/895/GCA_000297895.1_oyster_v9/GCA_000297895.1_oyster_v9_protein.faa.gz)




  * _Crassostrea virginica_



    * [GCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0_protein.faa.gz](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/002/022/765/GCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0/GCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0_protein.faa.gz)







##### Maker options control file (maker_opts.ctl):



This is a bit difficult to read in this notebook; copy and paste in text editor for easier viewing.

NOTE: Paths to files (e.g. genome FastA) have to be _relative_ paths; cannot be absolute paths!

    clean_up=0 #removes theVoid directory with individual analysis files, 1 = yes, 0 = no
    TMP= #specify a directory other than the system default temporary directory for temporary files
    </code>



After the run finishes, it will have produced a corresponding GFF file for each scaffold. This is unwieldly, so the GFFs will be merged using the following code:



    <code>$ gff3_merge -n -d Olurida_v081.maker.output/Olurida_v081_master_datastore_index.log</code>



All WORKERS were running as of 07:45 today. As of this posting (~3hrs later), WQ-MAKER had already processed ~45% of the files! Annotation will be finished by the end of today!!! Crazy!
