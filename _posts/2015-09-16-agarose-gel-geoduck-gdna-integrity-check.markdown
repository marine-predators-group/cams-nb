Ran 0.8% agarose 1x modified TAE gel stained with EtBr to assess the integrity of [geoduck gDNA isolated earlier today](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/09/16/genomic-dna-isolation-geoduck-adductor-muscle-foot-4/).

Ran ~500ng of each sample:

Geoduck adductor muscle 1: 4μL



Results:

The gDNA looks really good with a prominent high molecular weight band and little smearing.

Will proceed with pooling all accumulated geoduck gDNA for this project.
