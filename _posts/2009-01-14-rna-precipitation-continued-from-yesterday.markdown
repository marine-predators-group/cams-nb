Transferred supe to a fresh tube and added 1mL 70% EtOH to remaining pellet. Spun samples max speed @ 4C 30 mins. Removed supe and washed pellets with 1mL 70% EtOH. Spun max speed 10 mins. Removed supe . Resuspended the "supe" sample in 50uL 0.1%DEPC-H2O and the "pellet" sample in 100uL 0.1%DEPC-H2O.

Results: 260/280 ratios look good. The 260/230 ratios are still horrible. Total yield from these two samples are ~5ug. Will get more hemolymph from clams in order to use more total RNA in the mRNA isolation to maximize cost saving.
