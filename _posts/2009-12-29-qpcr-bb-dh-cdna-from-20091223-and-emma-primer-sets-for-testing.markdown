qPCR was set up on these cDNAs using the following primers:

EW778389.p.cg.6 ("DPGN", "Serine protease inhibitor dipetalogastin") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.

FP001672.p.cg.6 ("PGSC1", "Peptidoglycan-recognition protein SC1a/b") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.

Included three primer sets of Emma's (matrillin, beta tub and chaperonin). These were set up with no template and done in duplicate.

[qPCR set up and plate layout can be found here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091229-01.jpg).

Emma's "beta tub" primers show some weird fluorescence, however none of the primer sets show any thing in the melting curve analysis.
