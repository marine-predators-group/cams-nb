Well, my previous goal was to tidy up an [existing manuscript](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-Olurida-gene) and get it re-submitted to PeerJ. That's pretty much done, as Steven will be giving a final once over and formatting the rebuttal letter prior to resubmission.

June will be a bit of a short month for me, due to some travel, but here're some things on the agenda:





  * Update the [Oly Genome Wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-olympia.oyster-genomic/wiki) to accurately reflect the most recent [PacBio Sequencing](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-olympia.oyster-genomic/wiki/Genome-sequencing-December-2016-(UW-PacBio)) we had done.



  * Related to the above goal is updating [Nightingales](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/) to house just the raw sequencing data files for the Oly PacBio sequencing, while archiving the associated meta data (QC files, reports, etc).



  * Related to THAT goal is then updating our [Nightingales spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XqIOPVHSBVGscnjzDSWUeRL7HUHXfaHxVzec-I-8Xk/edit?usp=drive_web) to reflect, and provide links to, the raw sequencing files.



  * Establish (and build out) an "On Boarding" repo in the [Roberts Lab GitHub Page](https://github.com/RobertsLab). This should make it easier for new lab members to find the various resources they need. More importantly, it should make it easier for _us_ to direct people to find that info!
