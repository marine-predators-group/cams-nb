Rehydrated ATCC isolate according to directions. Added 5mL of 1x Marine Broth to a glass culture tube. Used 1mL of this to rehydrate ATCC sample and then added back into the culture tube. Added a few crystals of biphenyl, which had been exposed to UV for ~5mins prior. Incubated at 20C, no shaking. This was done at ~11:30AM.
