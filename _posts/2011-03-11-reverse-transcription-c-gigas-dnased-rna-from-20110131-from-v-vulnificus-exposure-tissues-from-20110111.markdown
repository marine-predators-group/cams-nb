Performed RT on DNased RNA using Promega MMLV RT and Oligo dT according to manufacturer's protocol, using 1ug of DNased RNA. Due to large number of samples, cDNA was made in PCR plate. [Plate layout and calcs are here](https://spreadsheets0.google.com/ccc?hl=en&hl=en&key=tGdgxaN5NchLx8wNDKAdWzg&authkey=CMrM2CM#gid=0). cDNA was diluted 4-fold (to 100uL total volume) based on qPCR done by Emma on 20110202.
