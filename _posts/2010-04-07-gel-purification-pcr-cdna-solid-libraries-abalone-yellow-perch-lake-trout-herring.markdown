cDNA was gel purified according to Ambion's Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit. The appropriate regions (100 - 200bp) were excised and cut in to 4, 1x5mm pieces. The two "internal" pieces were transferred to individual PCR tubes. The "outer" pieces were transferred together to a 1.5mL snap cap tube and stored @ -20C.

Three images are below. The first two are the gels before excising the 100 - 200bp region of the gel. The third is the image of the SECOND gel after the specified region was excised. An image was not taken of Gel 1 after excision (whoops!).

NOTE: The WB sample in the gell above is actually a yellow perch sample, NOT an abalone sample!

### In-gel PCR SOLiD Libraries - Abalone, Yellow Perch, Lake Trout, Herring



In-gel PCR was performed on the individual "internal" gel pieces that were excised, as described below from earlier today. PCR rxns/cycling were performed according to Ambion's Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit. PCR ran O/N. PCR master mix set up is here (bottom half of sheet).
