DNAsed RNA using Ambion Turbo DNA-free kit, following the rigorous procedure. Diluted total RNA to 0.2ug/uL (Vf = 720uL). Added 1uL DNase and incubated the tube @ 37C for 30mins. Added an additional 1uL DNase and continued incubated for 30mins. Added 0.2 volumes of DNase Inactivation Reagent (158.4uL) and incubated at RT for 10mins with periodic mixing. Pelleted inactivation reagent according to protocol and transferred supe (DNA-free RNA) to clean tube.

Results: RNA looks really nice. Have a large quantity of RNA (700uL x 0.2275ug/uL = 159.25ug). Will split into four equal parts and isolate mRNA from 3 of the 4. Those three will be:





  1. Ambion kit x 1



  2. Ambion kit x 2



  3. Promega PolyA Tract kit.
