The 8 hemo samples were pooled and the 4 gonad/d.g. samples were pooled. RNA was isolated. The homo sample was resuspended in 100uL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O and the gonad/d.g. sample was resuspended in 50uL 0.1%DEPC-H2O. RNA was precipitated O/N @ -20C according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](http://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf) in preparation for mRNA isolation.
