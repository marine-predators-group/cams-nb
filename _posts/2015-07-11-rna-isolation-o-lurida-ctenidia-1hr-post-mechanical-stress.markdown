Isolated RNA from [Jake's _Ostrea lurida_ ctenidia samples that had been subjected to mechanical stress (from 20150422)](http://heareresearch.blogspot.com/2015/04/4-22-2015-heatmechanical-shock.html).

Despite the indication in this notebook, the samples had not been previously homogenized in RNAzol RT. I thawed the samples, homogenized them and followed the [RNAzol RT protocol for total RNA isolation](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/MRC_RNAzol-RT-May-2014.pdf). Here's the list of samples:




    
  * 42215 NM1 1

    
  * 42215 NM1 2

    
  * 42215 NM1 3

    
  * 42215 NM1 4

    
  * 42215 NM1 5

    
  * 42215 NM1 6

    
  * 42215 NM1 7

    
  * 42215 NM1 8



RNA was resuspended in 50μL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O and stored @ -80C in the original box they came from.
