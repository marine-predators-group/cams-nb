Master mix containing Gigas gDNA will be used to verify that the recalibration did work. [qPCR setup/plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090827-01.jpg). I've made a master mix using Cg_HSP70_F/R primers designed by Mac. gDNA is BB #12 (0.445ug/uL) from [20090519](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090519). The gDNA will be added to the master mix.

Results: The results are a bit disconcerting, as this run shows virtually the exact same pattern in fluorescence detection as that on [20090722](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090722), despite using a different set of gigas gDNA. Below is a set of graphs comparing Column 1 Ct values of the two tests from [20090722](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090722) and today:

Clearly, both runs exhibit virtually the same pattern of relative Ct values to each other in each respective run. Not cool.
