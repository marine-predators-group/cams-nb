Ran a qPCR on all cDNA samples from the V.vulnificus exposure experiment from [20110111](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan+2011+-+March+2011#sjw20110111). Primers used were Cg_COX1/2_qPCR_F (SR ID: 1192) & Cg_COX2_454align1_R (SR ID: 1190). Samples were run in duplicate. [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110601-01.jpg). The master mix info is the same that was used earlier today, but with the primers noted above, not those listed on the calcs page. Plate layout, cycling params, etc., can be seen in the qPCR Report (see Results).

Results:

Data looks good (e.g. the replicates are all very close, with the largest Cq Std. Deviation = 1.227, although this does appear to be an anomaly as the next highest Cq Std. Deviation in any of the reps is 0.633), nothing in the NTCs, & the melt curves look good. Will eventually normalize the data and then perform a complete analysis.
