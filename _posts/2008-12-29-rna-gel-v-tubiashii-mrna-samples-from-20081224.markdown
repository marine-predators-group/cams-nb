Lane 1 - Empty
Lane 2 - Total RNA, Control
Lane 3 - mRNA, Control
Lane 4 - Total RNA, Vibrio+gigas
Lane 5 - mRNA, Vibrio+gigas

Results:

rRNA removal seems to have worked relatively well. Still some residual rRNA present in the mRNA samples. Will submit 200ng of the Vibrio+gigas mRNA to HTGU for Illumina sequencing.
