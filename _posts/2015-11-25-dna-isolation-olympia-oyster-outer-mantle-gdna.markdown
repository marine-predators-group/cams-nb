Since we still don't have sufficient gDNA for the full scope of the Olympia oyster genome sequencing, I isolated more gDNA.

Isolated gDNA from 118mg [outer mantle tissue collected by Steven & Brent on 20150812](http://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/12/another-day-another-species/).

Tissue was thoroughly minced with a clean razor blade and then processed with the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit (Omega BioTek) with the following changes:




    
  * Doubled solution volumes for steps before sample was loaded on columns

    
  * Sample was split equally in two tubes prior to addition of 100% EtOH

    
  * All mixing was done by shaking - no vortexing! Done this way to, hopefully, maintain gDNA integrity

    
  * Elution volume = 50μL

    
  * Elution was repeated using the initial elution to maximize recovery while maintaining low sample volume.

    
  * The two preps were pooled - final volume = 79μL



DNA was quantified using two methods: NanoDrop1000 & QuantIT dsDNA BR Kit

For the Quant-IT kit, the samples were quantified using the QuantIT dsDNA BR Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Standards were run in triplicate, samples were run in duplicate.

96-well black (opaque) plate was used.

Fluorescence was measured on the Seeb Lab's Victor 1420 plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

The NanoDrop1000 overestimates the concentration of the sample by 2.5x!

Regardless, this is a solid yield and, when combined with the other _Ostrea lurida_ gDNA that I cleaned up today, should push the total amount of gDNA submitted to BGI over the required threshold.

Will evaluate gDNA quality on a gel.
