The two pooled bisulfite-treated DNA samples (400ppm and 1000ppm) from [20150114](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/01/14/dna-bisulfite-conversion-c-gigas-larvae-oa-sheared-dna.html) were used to prepare bisulfite Illumina libraries with [EpiNext Post-Bisulfite DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) (Epigentek)(https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Epigentek_PostBisulfiteIlluminaLibraryPrep_P-1055.pdf).  Changes to the manufacturer's protocol:




    
  * Samples were transferred to 1.5mL snap cap tubes for all magnetic bead steps in order to fit in our tube magnets.

    
  * Stopped after End Repair step (prior to magnetic bead clean up).  Samples stored @ -20C
