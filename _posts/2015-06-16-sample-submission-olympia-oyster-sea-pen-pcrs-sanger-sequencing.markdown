Prepared two DNA plates and corresponding primer plates for sequencing at the UW HTGC from the purified [gel-purified PCRs from yesterday](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/06/15/gel-purification-olympia-oyster-and-sea-pen-pcrs/). Primer plates were prepared by adding 7μL of NanoPure H2O to each well and then adding 3μL of 10μM primer to the appropriate wells. For the DNA plates, added 10μL of DNA to the appropriate wells.

NOTE: The H2A_ST1 samples had insufficient volume of DNA for all four sequencing reactions. Added 30μL of NanoPure water to purified DNA, mixed and distributed to the appropriate wells.

Sequencing plates layouts can be seen here (Google Sheet): [sequence_log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV_gF766XZAcHljOFBWd3pLTUJwbUxkdkg1OGdCY3c&usp=sharing).

Submitted the plates to the UW HTGC for Sanger sequencing.
