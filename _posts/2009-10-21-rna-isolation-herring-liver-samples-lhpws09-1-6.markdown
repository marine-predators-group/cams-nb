From Seeb Lab. Homogenized entire liver samples in 5mL of TriReagent with the Tissue Tearers. In essence, based on the manufacturer's recommendation, this means the ratio of tissue:TriReagent was ~2x. Transferred 0.5mL of homogenized liver sample to 1.5mL snap cap tubes and added an additional 0.5mL of TriReagent, to adjust the ratio of tissue: TriReagent to ~1x. Samples were then stored @ -80C. These will be further processed once all remaining liver samples have been homogenized inTriReagent.
