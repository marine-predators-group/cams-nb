qPCR was performed with 16s_sybr primers on the DNased RNA that Lisa did. Annel temp 55C. [Sample set up and plate layout is here.](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090409-02.jpg)

Results: Still got signals in all of the samples, including the waters. Personally, I think the primers are contaminated or are forming crazy dimers. Lisa came by and picked up cDNA to run other genes on.
