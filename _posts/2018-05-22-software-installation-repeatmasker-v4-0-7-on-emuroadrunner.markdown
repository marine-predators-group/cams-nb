[Steven asked that I re-run some Olympia oyster transposable elements analysis](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/265) using RepeatMasker and a newer version of our Olympia oyster genome assembly.

Installed the software on both of the Apple Xserves (Emu and Roadrunner) running Ubuntu 16.04.

Followed the instructions outlined here:





  * [RepeatMasker Download page](http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html)



Starting with the prerequisites:

1. Download and install [RMBlast](http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMBlast.html)





  * NCBI Blast 2.6.0 source



  * isb 2.6.0 patch






Unfortunately, the `make` command continually failed:


    
    <code>cd /home/shared/ncbi-blast-2.6.0+-src/c++
    make</code>

While trying to troubleshoot this issue, continued with the other prerequisites:

2. Downloaded [Tandem Repeat Finder v.4.09](http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.download.html)





  * Saved file (`trf409.linux64`) to `/home/shared/bin`. NOTE: `/home/shared/bin` is part of the system PATH. See the `/etc/environment` file.



  * Changed permissions to be executable:





    
    <code>sudo chmod 775 trf409.linux64</code>





3. Downloaded [RepBase RepeatMasker Edition 20170127](https://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/index.php) (NOTE: This requires registration in order to obtain a username/password to download the file).

Installed RepeatMasker:

4. Downloaded [RepeatMasker 4.0.7](http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html)





  * Saved to `/home/shared/RepeatMasker-4.0.7`



5. Installed RepBase RepeatMasker Edition 20170127 in `/home/shared//home/shared/RepeatMasker-4.0.7/Libraries`

Currently re-building RMBlast and it takes _forever_... Will report back when I have it running.
