Prepared a short read archive (SRA) submission for archiving our Olympia oyster genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) data in NCBI. This is in preparation for submission of the [mansucript we're putting together](https://www.authorea.com/users/4974/articles/149442).

I f[ollowed my outline/guideline for navigating the SRA submission process](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2016/03/23/data-management-sra-submission-overview/), as it's a bit of a pain in the neck. Glad my notes were actually useful!

The following two files are currently being uploaded via FTP; the process will take about 3hrs, as each file is ~18GB in size:





  * [160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_1.fq.gz](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_1.fq.gz)



  * [160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_2.fq.gz](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/O_lurida/20160223_gbs/160123_I132_FCH3YHMBBXX_L4_OYSzenG1AAD96FAAPEI-109_2.fq.gz)








They are being submitted under the following accession numbers (note: a final accession number will be provided once this is publicly available; I will update this post when that happens):
