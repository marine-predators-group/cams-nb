Katie sent this additional info in an email to Steven and me:



<blockquote>
  These C. virginica samples were exposed to control (400, 6 samples) and OA (2800, 5 samples) conditions for ~4 weeks at 15C. Gonad was carefully extracted by peeling back the outer membrane, flash frozen in liquid N, and placed in -80C (until today when we removed it). During sampling, it was difficult to get a lot of what we considered  "pure” gonadal tissue. We sent you ~1/2 of the amount of tissue we have for all samples except for the two samples which were very low and we sent you all the tissue sample we have. Each should be about 10-20 mg of tissue, which I’m worried is not enough for MBD-BS seq. Fingers crossed.
