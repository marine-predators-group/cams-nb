mRNA was precipitated according to Ambion's MicroPolyA Purist Kit protocol. Added 0.1vols of ammonium acetate, 2.5vols of 100% EtOH and incubated 30mins @ -80C. Samples were pelleted, washed with 1mL 70% EtOH, pelleted, resuspended in 8uL of nuclease-free H2O and spec'd:

After precipitation, samples were fragmented with RNase III according to the Ambion Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit protocol and then cleaned up using the Invitrogen Ribominus Concentration Module, according to the Ambion Whole Transcriptome Analysis Kit protocol. 0.5uL of each sample was removed for analysis on the Bioanalyzer.
