This is an exact repeat of the qPCR from earlier today, but using a fresh working stock of the Vtub_16s_V3 primers. [The plate layout/qPCR workup is here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090302-2.jpg).

Results: Same as earlier today. Must be a bacterial contaminant somehwere that these 16s primers are picking up. Will order IGS primers that are species specific found in Lee et al. 2002.
