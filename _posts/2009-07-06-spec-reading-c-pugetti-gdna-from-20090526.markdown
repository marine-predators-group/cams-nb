A recent email from JGI indicates that they are satisfied with the quality of DNA (as seen on [20090601](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090601)), however their estimate of the gDNA concentration (42ng/uL) means that we have ~16ug of DNA. They requested 50ug. Based on the gel, their calculations are reasonable. However, the NanoDrop suggests that are sample is ~1350ng/uL! So, I've respec'd the sample and did a few dilutions to see how it looked.

Results: The undiluted sample is approximately the same concentration as initially reported. A 1:1 dilution produces the expected concentration of half the undiluted. The 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions deviate a bit from the expected concentrations, but are reasonably close. I still don't know how to explain the discrepancy between what the gel analysis suggests vs. the NanoDrop spectrophotometric data.
