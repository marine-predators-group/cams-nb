After confirming that the [DNA available for this project looked good](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/12/17/agarose-gel-oly-gdna-for-bs-seq-libraries-take-two/), I performed bisulfite treatment on the following gDNA samples:




    
  * 1NF11

    
  * 1NF15

    
  * 1NF16

    
  * 1NF17

    
  * 2NF5

    
  * 2NF6

    
  * 2NF7

    
  * 2NF8

    
  * NF2_6

    
  * NF2_18

    
  * M2

    
  * M3



Sample names breakdown like this:

1NF#

1 = Fidalgo Bay outplants

NF = Fidalgo Bay broodstock origination

# = Sample number

2NF#

Same as above, but:

2 = Oyster Bay outplants

NF2_# (Oysters grown in Oyster Bay; [DNA provided by Katherine Silliman](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/11/25/samples-received-oly-tissue-dna-from-katherine-silliman/))


NF2 = Fidalgo Bay broodstock origination, family #2

# = Sample number

M2/M3 = C.gigas from Katie Lotterhos



Followed the guidelines of the [TruSeq DNA Methylation Library Prep Guide (Illumina)](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/Illumina_truseq-dna-methylation-library-prep-guide-15066014-a.pdf).

Used the [EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (ZymoResearch)](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/ZymoResearch_EZ_DNA_Methylation-Gold_Kit_d5005i.pdf) according to the manufacturer's protocol with the following changes/notes:




    
  * Used 100ng DNA (per Illumina recs; Zymo recommends at least 200ng for "optimal results").

    
  * Thermal cycling was performed in 0.5mL thin-wall tubes in a PTC-200 (MJ Research) using a heated lid

    
  * Centrifugations were performed at 13,000g

    
  * Desulphonation incubation for 20mins.



DNA quantity calculations are here (Google Sheet): [20151218_oly_bisulfite_calcs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BA2REjyCBLv_ekstyND1nl9aXal29Z4jRRLyasRSyZM/edit?usp=sharing)

Samples were stored @ -20C. Will check samples via Bioanalyzer before proceeding to library construction.
