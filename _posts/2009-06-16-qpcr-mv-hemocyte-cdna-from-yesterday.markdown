[qPCR set up/plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090615-02.jpg). Used Cv_18s_F/R primers to assess samples' "useability" for future qPCRs. Used an ABI optically clear adhesive film instead of caps. Ran out of appropriate caps.

Results: Yep, seal was bad. Explains most of the weirdness seen. However, will compare SYTO and Strategene SYBR.
