Per Mac's request, ran a PCR on a set of bisulfite-treated DNA (in her gDNA 2014 box in small -20C):



	
  * EV2.16 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.20 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.22 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.24 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.28 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.29 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.32 bisulfite

	
  * EV2.33 bisulfite


DNA needed to be diluted. Diluted according to this sheet provided by Mac:

[https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/bivalvia/070914bisulfite.pdf](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Feagle.fish.washington.edu%2Fbivalvia%2F070914bisulfite.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH03hxTLMRRASsvjw-MxWrSjGrYiQ)

NOTE: EV2.28 didn't have sufficient DNA left to prepare the dilution according to Mac's sheet. Instead, the remaining volume ofEv2.28 bisulfite DNA (0.5uL) was diluted in a total volume of 2.5uL to maintain the same dilution ratio.

Master mix calcs are here: [20140828 - PCR Mac Bisulfite Samples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X6no-kLxJw15cuo84dJc_JmHO_0445nJmSqvya6DiGE/edit?usp=sharing)

Primers used were:


CgBS_733_26796Seq (SRID: 1598)




CgBS_733_26796R_5'biotin (SRID: 1596)


Cycling params:



	
  1. 1. 95C - 10mins

	
  2. 2. 94C - 30s

	
  3. 3. 56C - 30s

	
  4. 4. 72C - 30s

	
  5. 5. Repeat steps 2 - 5 44 more times

	
  6. 6. 72C - 10mins

Ladder used is O'GeneRuler 100bp DNA Ladder (ThermoFisher).

According to Mac, the expected band size is ~300bp. However, all samples are running at ~150bp. Mac is confused and does not know what to do.

*UPDATE 20140902* - Realized I used the wrong forward primer! Will repeat PCR with correct primer. Wonder if Mac did the same thing...
