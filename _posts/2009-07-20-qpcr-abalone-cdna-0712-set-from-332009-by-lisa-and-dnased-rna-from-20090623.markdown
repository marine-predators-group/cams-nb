Now that we have a solid positive control, I'll use the H.crach_h-1fg_intron primers to check the existing cDNA and DNased RNA. [qPCR plate layout/set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090720-01.jpg). Anneal temp 50C.

Results: Looks like all the cDNA and DNased RNA are negative ! Finally! Will make cDNA from the DNased RNA.
