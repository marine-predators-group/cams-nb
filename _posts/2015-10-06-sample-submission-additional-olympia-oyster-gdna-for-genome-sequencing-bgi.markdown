Previous shipment of gDNA proved to be of insufficient quantity when assessed by BGI, so needed to isolate more.

Shipped the pooled gDNA we've been accumulating to BGI to contine the geoduck genome sequencing project.

Sample was shipped on dry ice with the appropriate paperwork required by BGI (sample declaration letter).
