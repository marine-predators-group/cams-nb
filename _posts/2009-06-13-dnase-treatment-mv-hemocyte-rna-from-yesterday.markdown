Samples 3326: B23, A25, A22, B14, A21, A10 B22 came up positive for gDNA still. These were retreated according to Ambion protocol with a brand new Turbo DNA-free DNase kit. Additionally, I tested all three existing kits by "spiking" 19uL of H2O with 1uL (~200ng) of gigas gDNA; one tube for each kit and an untreated sample. Will qPCR to see if gDNA removal was successful.
