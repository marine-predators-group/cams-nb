From the Seeb Lab. Homogenized entire gonad/ovary samples in 5mL of TriReagent with the sonicator. In essence, based on the manufacturer's recommendation, this means the ratio of tissue:TriReagent was ~2x. Transferred 0.5mL of homogenized gonad/ovary sample to 1.5mL snap cap tubes and added an additional 0.5mL of TriReagent, to adjust the ratio of tissue:TriReagent to ~1x. Samples were then stored @ -80C. These will be further processed tomorrow.
