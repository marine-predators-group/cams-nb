Sent plasmid prep to ASU (5uL of plasmid + 1uL of 10uM M13F/R). SJW01 = M13F, SJW02 = M13R.

Results:

Sequencing looks great! Definitely have a portion of the second isoform of COX/PGS!! Here's the result of the consensus BLASTed in GenBank>Nucleotide (others)>blastn:

Top hit in the db is COX1/PGS1, and, clearly, there are differences between the two sequences confirming that we have the second isoform (COX2/PGS2). Will design more RACE primers in hopes of obtaining the full-length cDNA sequence.
