### Review of [last month's goals](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015/07/02/goals-july-2015.html):





#### _O.lurida_ RNA Isolation & Reverse Transcription -



RNA has been isolated and DNased from Jake's mechanically stressed samples.



#### Miscellany -



Improved organization of -80C, added frequently used protocols to [the Roberts Lab GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/wiki), connected BGI rep with purchasing to get the PO situation figured out for Olympia oyster and geoduck genome sequencing, sent samples to BGI for Olympia oyster genome-by-sequencing (GBS).

###  _O.lurida_ Reverse Transcription



Need to quantify the DNased RNA from Jake's mechanically stressed oysters and then verify that the DNase treatment worked. Will then proceed with reverse transcription.



### Miscellany



Continue work on -80C organization, continue creating "readme" files for folders on our server(s), continue migration from Wikispaces to GitHub, attempt to combine our PrimerDatabase and our Primer Stocks spreadsheets into a single document (and create a SQL database from that), fix the shortfalls from our EH&S lab inspection.
