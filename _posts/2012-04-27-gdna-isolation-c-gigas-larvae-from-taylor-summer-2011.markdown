Samples that had been split from earlier today (see the RNA Isolation below) were resuspended in 1mL of DNAzol (MRC). 100ug of Proteinase K (Fermentas) was added to each sample. Samples were incubated at RT, O/N on a rotator. On 20120427 samples were pelleted 10mins, 10,000g, and supe transferred to fresh tube. DNA was precipitated with 0.5mL of 100% EtOH, mixed gently and pelleted 5mins, 5000g. Supe was discarded, pellets were washed with 1mL 75% EtOH, re-pelleted at same speed as previous step, supe discarded and pellets were resuspended in NanoPure H2O. Samples were spec'd on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000.

Results:

Report on the NanoDrop software wouldn't display, so I've entered the concentration of each sample in the table below.
