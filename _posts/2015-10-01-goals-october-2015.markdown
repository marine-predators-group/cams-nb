I'd review last month's goals, but I completely forgot to post them!

However, I did accomplish the two most important goals that I needed to get done last month:





  * Prep Olympia oyster (_Ostrea lurida_) gDNA for genome sequencing



  * Prep geoduck (_Panopea generosa_) gDNA for genome sequencing








For this month, I'm looking at tackling the following:




    
  * Prep RAD libraries to assess viability of the process on degraded Olympia oyster gDNA

    
  * Implement lab safety changes to be in compliance

    
  * Establish an "onboarding" (that's fancy corporate speak) guide for getting new lab members up-to-speed

    
  * Continue working on a revamped primer database that will be a single resource (currently, it's split in two spreadsheets and is not easily manageable/searchable)
