This is a repeat of a run from 20110204. Here're master mix calcs. This was being repeated to evaluate whether or not the relative differences in Ct values observed on 20110204 are consistent or not across the plate. Cycling params were as follows:




    
  * 95C - 10min



40 Cycles of:


    
  * 95C - 15s

    
  * 55C - 30s

    
  * 72C - 1m



Melt curve.

Results:

Absolutely no amplification of any kind! Bizarre. Will repeat.
