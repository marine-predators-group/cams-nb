Prepared the RNA Pico 6000 ladder (Agilent) according to the manufacturer's protocol:




    
  * Denatured @ 70C for 2mins

    
  * Immediately put on ice

    
  * Added 90μL H2O



Made 2μL aliquots of the ladder in 0.5mL snap cap tubes. Samples were boxed, labeled, and stored @ -80C (Rack #9).
