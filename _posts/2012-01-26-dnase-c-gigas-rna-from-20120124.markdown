5ug of each RNA was DNased using Ambion's Turbo DNA-free Kit, according to the rigorous protocol and spec'd on Roberts Lab NanoDrop 1000. [RNA volume calcs are here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdEJBaExkeTVQb1BoWFkyaHNLQnN0T0E#gid=0).

DNased RNA looks fine. Low OD260/280 ratios, but this is often seen after DNase treatment and particularly with low [RNA]. Will perform qPCR to assess gDNA removal.
