Amazingly, we need more gDNA for the two genome sequencing projects (geoduck and Olympia oyster). Used geoduck "foot 1" sample from Box 1 of the [foot samples collected by Brent & Steven on 20150811.](http://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/11/big-day-big-clam/) Used Olympia oyster adductor muscle from Box 1 of [adductor muscle sample collected by Brent & Steven on 20150812.](http://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/12/another-day-another-species/)

Also need to evaluate DNA quality of initial broodstock samples from Jake's Olympia oyster reciprocal transplant experiment. Used mantle samples stored in EtOH collected by Hannah ([see her notebook entries on July 25 & Sept 5, 2013](https://genefish.wikispaces.com/Hannah's+notebook))

Tissue weights:




    
  * Geoduck foot: 108.5mg (gone)

    
  * Olympia oyster adductor: 258.7mg (gone)

    
  * Oly NF1A: 7.1mg (gone)

    
  * Oly SN49A: 20.8mg





Samples were isolated using DNAzol (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with the following adjustments:




    
  * Tissues homogenized in 750μL of DNAzol with disposable mortar/pestle tubes using 10 pestle strokes

    
  * After homogenization, topped off tubes to 960μL with DNAzol, added 40μL RNAse A (100mg/mL) and incubated @ RT for 15mins.

    
  * Performed optional centrifugation step (10,000g, 10mins @ RT)

    
  * Initial pellet wash was performed using a 70%/30% DNAzol/EtOH

    
  * Pellets were resuspended Buffer EB (Qiagen)

    
  * Insoluble material was pelleted (12,000g, 10mins @ RT) and supe transferred to new tubes





Genome sequencing resuspension volumes: 50μL

Oly reciprocoal resuspension volumes: 25μL

Spec'd on Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000.

#### Genome Sequencing Samples



The 260/280 ratios look fine. The 260/230 ratios look poor, as is usually the case after DNAzol isolations.

Yields:

Geoduck: 7.6μg

Oly: 16.5μg

The geoduck yield is insufficient to make up the quantity of gDNA still needed by BGI for sequencing. Will have to isolate more gDNA on Monday.





#### Reciprocal Transplant Samples



The 260/280 ratios look fine. The 260/230 ratios look poor, as is usually the case after DNAzol isolations.

Yields:

NF1A: 7,1μg

SN49A: 1.375μg

The yields are surprisingly good! Next up is to evaluate the gDNA quality on a gel to see if the samples from this experiment will be usable.
