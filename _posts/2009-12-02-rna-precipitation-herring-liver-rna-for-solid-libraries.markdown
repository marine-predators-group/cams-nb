50uL of RNA from each of the following were precipitated O/N @ -20C:

2L HKOD09 - 2.157 ug/uL x 50uL = 107.85ug

4L HTOG09 - 2.089 ug/uL x 50uL = 104.45ug

3L HSITK09 - 1.089 ug/uL x 50uL = 54.45ug

6L HPWS09 - 1.703 ug/uL x 50uL = 85.15ug

0.1 volumes (5uL) of 3M NaOAc ph = 5.2 was added to each sample. Then 2 volumes (110uL) of 100% EtOH was added. Samples were vortexed and incubated O/N @ -20C.
