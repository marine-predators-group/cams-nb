Made a fresh, double batch (50uL rxn instead of 25uL) of cDNA according to Promega MMLV protocol using oligo dT primers. cDNA was put into a plate for faster qPCR loading. [cDNA calcs and plate layout are here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdFVBS3FUQy12a1ZMekZ4OC1vTnA2aGc&hl=en). Briefly, RNA and oligo dTs were combined, brought up to 37uL, heated @ 70C for 5mins and immediately placed on ice. RT master mix was made ([RT master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091223-01.jpg)), 13uL was distributed to each well. Samples were incubated @ 42C for 1hr and then 95C for 5mins.

UPDATE: cDNA plate was discarded 20120320 by SJW.
