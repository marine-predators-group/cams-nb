Used new cyclooxygenase primers (SR IDs 1060, 1061) to see how they performed and to evaluate tissue distribution. Tissue distribution was evaluated using the following cDNAs made on 10/27/10 from Emma:

Gigas Digestive Gland

Gigas Gill

Gigas Mantle

Gigas Muscle

[qPCR Master Mix calcs are here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdE1Eb3lBQkQ2RFFRZnBKYUI5VFBENUE&hl=en&authkey=COjq-m8#gid=0). Plate layout, cycling parameters, etc can be found in the qPCR Report (see Results).

Amplification is present in all four tissue types and the melting curve looks good. So, these primers are good to go. Steven suggests checking to see if we see a change in gene expression from an old experiment of Gigas exposed to high levels of Vibrio tubiashii. Will round up some old cDNA for this.
