Ran qPCR on DNased Abalone Dg RNA (07:12 Set), gDNA (06:50-10) and clean cDNA (from [20090422](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090422)) using primers (H.crach_h-1fg_intron_Fw/Rv) designed to bind only to a region in an intron of the H.cracherodii hemocyanin gene. [PCR setup/plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090708-01.jpg). Anneal temp of 50C was used.

Results: No PCR products in any samples, not even the positive control. It seems that the primers don't work. Will design new primers, probably from a different species of abalone since there was essentially only one gene in H.cracherodii that had any intron sequence available..
