The [last "fix"](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2017/11/20/troubleshooting-pb-jelly-install-on-emu.html) didn't fix everything.

This time, I received an error message that was related to blasr. Some internet searching revealed that I needed to have various library files saved to a variable named: `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

To fix this, I added the following line to the `/etc/bash.bashrc` file:

`
    
    export "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}/home/shared/lib:"</code>



The line uses a fancy bash test to determine if the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable already exists. This is to prevent the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH from having a leading ":".

As usual, the solution to that problem was found courtesy of [StackExchange (#162891)(https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/162891/append-to-path-like-variable-without-creating-leading-colon-if-unset).

Also, by putting this line in the `/etc/bash.bashrc` file, it makes the variable available for all users.

Below are some screen caps to document the process:

#### Add command to /etc/bash.bashrc to set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
