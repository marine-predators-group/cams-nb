Performed an EtOH on gel-purified PCR products from 20110921. Briefly, added 0.1 vols of 3M sodium acetate (pH=5.2; 43uL), mixed and then added 2.5 vols of 100% EtOH (1182.5uL). Mixed, split into two tubes (due to high volume not fitting in a single tube) and incubated @ -80C O/N. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 20mins, 4C. Discarded supe. Washed pellet w/ 1mL 70% EtOH. Pelleted DNA 16,000g, 15mins, 4C. Discarded supe. Resuspended both pellets in a TOTAL of 25uL Qiagen Buffer EB (10mM Tris-HCl) and spec'd.

Now have sufficient DNA for sequencing.

What's next?

Generate PCR product using primers that anneal OUTSIDE of each of the qPCR primers and then sequence those bands to ensure that the qPCR primers are actually annealing to two different isoforms.
