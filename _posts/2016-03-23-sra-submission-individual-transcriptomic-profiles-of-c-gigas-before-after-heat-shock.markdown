RNA-seq experiment conducted by [Claire in 2013](https://claireeolson.blogspot.com/).

She sampled mantle tissue from three adult oysters, allowed them to recover from the sampling (one week?) and then subjected those same oysters to a 1hr heat shock at 40C and collected mantle tissue from them again.

As this is our first Small Read Archive (SRA) submission in many years, I decided to submit these to the SRA due to the small number of samples (6) from the Illumina sequencing we had done to make sure it was manageable.

[An overview of the basic SRA submission process is here](2016/03/23/data-management-sra-submission-overview.html).

The current status can be seen in the screen cap below. Current release date is set for a year from now, but will likely bump it up. Need Steven to review the details of the submission (BioProject, Experiment descriptions, etc.) before I initiate the public release. Will update this post with the SRA number once we receive it.

Here's the list of files uploaded to the SRA:
