Performed RT using Promega M-MLV RT according to M-MLV protocol and used 0.5ug oligo dT per ug of RNA on all BB and DH site samples that were negative for gDNA (see qPCR results [20090512](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090512)). [Calculations and work up are here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdE1WT0dVbVFxQ0o1TkJXalF5MXFhcXc&hl=en). Samples were set up in a plate to facilitate sample loading in subsequent qPCRs.

UPDATE: cDNA plate was discarded 20120320 by SJW.
