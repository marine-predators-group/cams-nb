See the Next Gen Seq Library Database for more info. Processed the 4 samples (one set Ribominus only, one set Ribominus + PolyA enriched) according to the Agilent WTK. Briefly:




    
  * Speedvac'd samples to dryness

    
  * Resuspended RNA in 3uL H2O

    
  * Adapter rxn. Used all 3uL of RNA (used only 1uL of RBC Ribo only sample due to high concentration)

    
  * Ligation rxn



Incubated 16C for 16hrs.
