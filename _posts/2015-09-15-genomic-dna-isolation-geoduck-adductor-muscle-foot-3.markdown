Isolated gDNA from _Panopea generosa_ (geoduck) [adductor muscle & foot samples collected by Brent & Steven on 20150811](https://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/11/big-day-big-clam/) using the DNAzol (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following adjustments:




    
  * 102.5mg of adductor muscle 1

    
  * 76.7mg of adductor muscle 2

    
  * 84.2mg of foot 1

    
  * 54.5mg of foot 2

    
  * Tissues homogenized in 750μL of DNAzol with disposable mortar/pestle tubes using 10 pestle strokes

    
  * After homogenization, topped off tubes to 1000μL with DNAzol and incubated @ RT for 10mins.

    
  * Performed optional centrifugation step (10,000g, 10mins @ RT)

    
  * Initial pellet wash was performed using a 70%/30% DNAzol/EtOH

    
  * Pellets were resuspended in 200μL of Buffer EB (Qiagen)

    
  * Insoluble material was pelleted (12,000g, 10mins @ RT) and supe transferred to new tubes



Spec'd on Roberts Lab NanoDrop1000 (ThermoFisher) and stored temporarily at 4C to avoid freeze-thawing before sending off for sequencing next week.

There was a great deal of insoluble material from the get-go that was carried through the entire isolation.

Overall, the 260/280 ratios look pretty good, but the 260/230 ratios are just trash. As can be seen in the plots above, there is clearly significant absorbance in the 230 – 250nm, suggesting some contaminant carryover (phenol/salt).

Will evaluate gDNA integrity on agarose gel.

Yields from this isolation:

Adductor muscle 1: 11.03μg

Adductor muscle 2: 1.95μg

Foot 1: 4.6μg

Foot 2: 1.64μg



Total geoduck gDNA from this isolation: 19.2μg



Total geoduck gDNA accumulated for this project: 69μg

Still need an additional 4μg at a minimum! Will isolate more gDNA tomorrow...
