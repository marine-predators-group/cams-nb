Isolated gDNA from the following two samples:

MIE-14y

VNTc-1.2-C1/G10

Samples were spun @ 16,000g @ RT for 2mins. No visible pellets in either sample. EtOH was removed. "Pellets" were washed in 1x PBS (pH=7.6) two times and then the Qiagen DNEasy Kit protocol was followed. Samples were incubated @ 55C with Proteinase K for ~2hrs.

Results: Both samples show really, really low quantities of gDNA.
