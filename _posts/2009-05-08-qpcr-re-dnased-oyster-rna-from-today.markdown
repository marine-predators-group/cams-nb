Performed qPCR on the re-DNased oyster RNA from earlier today with Gigas_18s_F/R primers to verify removal of detectable gDNA in the samples, since the initial qPCR from yesterday indicated residual gDNA was still present in the DNase treated RNA. [Plate layout/set up can be found here.](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090508-03.jpg)

Results: About 4 samples in each site set are NEGATIVE for gDNA. That means the remainder still have detectable levels of gDNA. Boo.
