#### RNA Precipitation



Sample was spun 16,000g, 30mins, 4C. Supe removed. Pellet washed with 1mL 70% EtOH. Spun 16,000g, 10mins, 4C. Supe removed. Pellet resuspended in 250uL of nuclease free H2O. Will proceed with mRNA isolation.





#### mRNA Isolation



Isolated mRNA using Ambion's MicroPolyA Purist Kit according to protocol. Performed two rounds of isolation to decrease residual rRNA carryover that we frequently see after a single round.

Results:

Started with ~90ug of total RNA. Yield of mRNA = 3.26ug. That is a ~3.6% recovery of mRNA.
