Set up qPCR with Cv_18s_F/R primers on the following samples that had previously come up negative in both reps using the diluted (1:20) cDNA that Mac had made specifically for the 18s runs:

3326A13

2100B07

3219A06

2100B15

3326A11

2100B12

2100A03

[Plate layout/PCR set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090706-01.jpg). This is a second rep of these samples.

Results: Waters are clean. However, the following samples still are negative for an 18s amplicon:
