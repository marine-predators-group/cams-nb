Spun samples 16,000g, 30mins, 4C. Discarded supe, quick spun tubes, removed residual supe, washed with 1mL 70% EtOH. Spun samples 16,000g, 15mins, 4C. Discarded supe, quick spun tubes, removed residual supe, resuspended in 8.5uL of nuclease-free H2O. Stored @ -80C until ready to proceed with fragmentation for SOLiD libraries.
