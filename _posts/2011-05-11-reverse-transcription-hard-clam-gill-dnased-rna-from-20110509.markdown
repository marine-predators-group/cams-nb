Performed reverse transcription on DNased RNA from the hard clam vibrio tubiashii challenge experiment (see Dave's Notebook 5/2/2011), following the Promega M-MLV RT protocol with ~1ug of DNAsed RNA. [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110511-01.jpg). Reactions were done in a plate. cDNA was diluted 1:4 with H2O.
