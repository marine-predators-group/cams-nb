Sent the following samples to Illumina for possible selection in a new pilot sequencing platform they're working on.

The 12 samples will be used for RNAseq for genome annotation - numbers indicate desired sequencing priority.

Juvenile and larval samples were from Hollie Putnam (see links below for more info).

Other tissue was from a single, adult geoduck, collected by [Brent & Steven on 20150811](http://onsnetwork.org/halfshell/2015/08/11/big-day-big-clam/).





  1. Gonad


  2. Heart


  3. Ctenidia


  4. Juvenile OA exposure (super low)  ([EPI_115, EPI_116](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/Setup_Notes/Sample_List.csv))


  5. Juvenile ambient exposure (ambient treatment) ([EPI_123, EPI_124](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/Setup_Notes/Sample_List.csv))


  6. Larvae day 0 ([EPI_74, EPI_75](https://github.com/hputnam/project_larval_geoduck_OA/edit/master/Larval_Sample_Info.csv))


  7. Larvae day 5 ([EPI_99](https://github.com/hputnam/project_larval_geoduck_OA/edit/master/Larval_Sample_Info.csv))


  8. Crystalline style


  9. Byssus gland


  10. Mantle


  11. Labial palps


  12. Juvenile OA exposure - low treatment ([EPI_107, EPI_108](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/blob/master/Setup_Notes/Sample_List.csv))





In addition to the above 12 samples, ~1.5μg of geoduck gDNA ([isolated this morning](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2016/12/21/dna-isolation-geoduck-gdna-for-potential-illumina-initiated-sequencing-project/)) was sent.
