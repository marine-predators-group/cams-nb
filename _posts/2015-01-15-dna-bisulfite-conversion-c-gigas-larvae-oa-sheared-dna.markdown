After discussing with Steven, decided to use only samples from 20110513, due to high algae amounts present in the 20110519 samples.

Pooled the DNA of the 400ppm samples (6B2 & 6B5) and pooled the DNA of the 1000ppm samples(1B1 & 1B2) , for a total of two samples. 50ng of each sample was used to make the pools, for a toal of 100ng of DNA in each pool. Calculations are below:

``

Each pooled sample was brought up to a final volume of 24μL for use in bisulfite conversion kit.

Performed bisulfite conversion of sheared DNA from [20150113](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2015-01-12-speedvac-c-gigas-larvae-oa-dna.html) using the Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (Epigentek) according the manufacturer's protocol.

Samples were eluted with 10μL of Buffer R6 and stored @ -20C.
