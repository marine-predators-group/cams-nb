[Earlier today I finished trimming](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/05/16/trimgalorefastqcmultiqc-trimgalore-rrbs-geoduck-bs-seq-fastq-data/) Hollie's RRBS BS-seq FastQ data.

However, the original files were never analyzed with FastQC, so I ran it on the original files.

These libraries were originally created by Hollie Putnam using the TruSeq DNA Methylation Kit (Illumina):





  * [project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/Sample_Processing (GitHub)](https://github.com/hputnam/project_juvenile_geoduck_OA/tree/master/Sample_Processing)



FastQC was run, followed by MultiQC. Analysis was run on Roadrunner.

All analysis is documented in a Jupyter Notebook; see link below.
