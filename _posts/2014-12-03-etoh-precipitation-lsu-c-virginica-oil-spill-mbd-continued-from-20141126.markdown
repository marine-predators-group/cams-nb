Precipitation was continued according to the MethylMiner Methylated DNA Enrichment Kit (Invitrogen). Since I will need sample volumes of 24uL for the subsequent bisulfite conversion, I resuspended the samples in 29uL of water (will use 2.5uL x 2 reps for quantification).

Samples to be quantified:

NC = non-captured (i.e. non-methylated)

E = eluted (i.e. methylated)




    
  * HB2 NC

    
  * HB5 NC

    
  * HB16 NC

    
  * HB30 NC

    
  * NB3 NC

    
  * NB6 NC

    
  * NB11 NC

    
  * NB21 NC

    
  * HB2 E

    
  * HB5 E

    
  * HB16 E

    
  * HB30 E

    
  * NB3 E

    
  * NB6 E

    
  * NB11 E

    
  * NB21 E

    
  * Control NC

    
  * Control E



Samples were quantified using the Quant-IT BS Kit (Invitrogen) with a plate reader (BioTek). All samples were run in duplicate. Used 2.5uL of each sample for quantification.

Samples were stored in @ -20C (FTR 209) in the bisulfite seq box created by Claire for this project.
