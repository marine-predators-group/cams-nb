This is a repeat of yesterday's set up with LABY primers, but with an annealing temp of 53C in hopes of improving the number of amplicons generated from additional samples. See yesterday's PCR run for info on samples.

Results: Samples were loaded 1-29 and three negative controls from left to right, top to bottom.

The lower annealing temperature clearly resulted in more products. The ~500bp band was cut from each lane and stored @ -20C. All bands will be purified using Millipore spin columns and then sent for sequencing.
