qPCR was performed with 16s_sybr primers on a subset of the "No RT" cDNA rxns from yesterday at both 55C and 60C. [Sample set up and plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090409-01.jpg).

Results: Still getting signals in the "No RT" rxns and possibly in the waters. Cut run short to start another. Will test Lisa's previously DNased RNA.
