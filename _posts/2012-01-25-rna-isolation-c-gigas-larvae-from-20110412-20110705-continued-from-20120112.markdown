All of the RNA samples were re-combined with their respective counterparts and subject to a standard EtOH precipitation (0.1 volumes of 3M NaOAc, pH = 5.2, 2.5 volumes 100% EtOH; incubated -80C 1hr; pelleted; washed with 1mL 70% EtOH; pelleted). Pellets were washed two additional times (for a total of three washes) with 70% EtOH. RNA was resuspended in 50uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O and spec'd on the Roberts Lab NanoDrop 1000.

Yields for the 4/12/2011 samples were all lower than the yields for the 7/5/2011 samples. However, the RNA quality (based on OD260/280 ratios) looks pretty good for both groups of RNA. RNA will be treated with DNase before reverse transcription.
