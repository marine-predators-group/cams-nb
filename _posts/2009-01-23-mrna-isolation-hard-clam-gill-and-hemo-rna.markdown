mRNA was isolated according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf). After mixing samples with resin, samples were incubated @ RT for 1hr. Samples were washed per the protocol. However, the hemo sample was not clearing from the spin columns with the protocol-directed 3 min. spins. The column had to be spun up to 15 mins. in order for the column to clear. :(

Results: The gill mRNA looks good (~1.8ug). The concentration of the hemo sample is extremely low and is below the error threshold for the NanoDrop, but it may not be that bad. The samples are in a relatively large volume (~200uL) and the yield is expected to be very small. So, I will precipitate these samples O/N @ -20C according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](https://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf) in order to concentrate them.
