This is a repeat of the two runs from yesterday, just to see if there is a correlation between the failed plates being the first of the day or not. M[aster mix calcs and cycling params are here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110208-01.jpg) (these calcs are from yesterday, but were used again for today).

Results:

Amplification in all wells. Still seeing ~3 cycle spread across the entire plate. Will work up all three successful sets of run data.
