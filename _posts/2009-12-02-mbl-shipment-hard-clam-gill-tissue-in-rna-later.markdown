Received samples from Scott Lindell today. Two Ziplock bags taped together labelled "11/16/09 Clams scudders." The bags contain 2mL screw cap tubes with small tissue samples in RNA later. One group of tubes is labelled with FL-3 # and the other group with BX-4 #. Samples will be stored at 4C to be processed later this month.
