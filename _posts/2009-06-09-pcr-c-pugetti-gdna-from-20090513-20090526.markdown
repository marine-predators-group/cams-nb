Previous PCRs from [20090601](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090601) & [20090602](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090602) both showed contamination in the negative control. Suspect that the primer stocks were contaminated due to the usage of older, non-sterile TE for reconstitution. New stocks were received and reconstituted with filter-sterilized TE. Working stocks were made with filter-sterilized Nanopure H2O. All pipettes, tips, tubes, racks were UV-sterilized in the biological hood. The PCR reaction was set up in the biological hood. [PCR set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090608-02.jpg). Used universal 16s bacteria primers (27F, 1492R). Sequences from Sara Kelly. Anneal 60C.
