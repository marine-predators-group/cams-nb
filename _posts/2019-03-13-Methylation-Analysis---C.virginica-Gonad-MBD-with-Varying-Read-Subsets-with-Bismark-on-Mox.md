Steven asked for the following analysis in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/609) using Yaamini's _C.virginica_ MBD samples:

> - Average read count for a single library
> - 50% of average read count for a single library
> - All data
> - 50% of all data

> Questions to addressed
> Mean CpG Coverage
> % CpG Coverage at 5x
> % CpG Coverage at 10x
> Any "Report" information automatically calculated by Bismark.

[I made a bisulfite converted genome](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/12/Data-Management-Create-C.virginica-Bisulfite-Genome-with-Bismark-on-Mox.html) using the NCBI GCF_002022765.2_C_virginica-3.0 version.

Set up the following SBATCH script to run on Mox:

- [20190312_cvir_gonad_bismark.sh](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/sbatch_scripts/20190312_cvir_gonad_bismark.sh) (GitHub)

_NOTE_: It seems as though the if/else statement didn't work properly and resulted in a duplicated analysis of the "half total reads". The "total reads" will be run independently.

_2nd NOTE_: Actually, the "problem" was that I was calculating read counts based on combining R1 and R2 reads. However, Bismark uses the subsetting option to run on read pairs (i.e. -u 1000 would run 1000 read pairs which is 2000 reads). So, my usage was incorrect. Fixed and re-ran.

### RESULTS

This took a pretty long  time to run (6days 16hrs):

![6 days, 16hrs runtime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/master/images/screencaps/20190320_bismark_complete.png)


Additionally, I don't have the time at the moment to actually finish the analysis to evaluate differences in coverage. I'm posting notebook entry to make data available (belatedly) and will get some sort of comparison analysis done in the near future...
