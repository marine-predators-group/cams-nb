Extracted DNA from the following water filter samples using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit:




    
  * 158

    
  * 200

    
  * 279

    
  * 313

    
  * 341

    
  * 410

    
  * 433

    
  * 503

    
  * 551

    
  * 604



Filters were cut into ~13 pieces and placed in 1.5mL snap cap tubes containing 50uL of Proteinase K and 400uL of Buffer AL. Samples were incubated O/N @ 56C. Tubes were spun @ 16,000g @ RT for 2mins. 400uL of 100% EtOH was added to each tube and vortexed. Tubes were spun @ 16,000g @ RT for 2mins. Supe was transferred to Qiagen column. Qiagen protocol was followed from this point on. Samples were eluted with 100uL of Buffer AE and stored @ 4C.
