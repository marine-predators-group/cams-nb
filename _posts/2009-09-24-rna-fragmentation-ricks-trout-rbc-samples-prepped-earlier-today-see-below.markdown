Samples were fragmented according to the Whole Transcriptome Kit protocol. Samples were then cleaned up using Invitrogen's Modified RiboMinus Concentration Module, according to protocol. Briefly:




    
  * Added 1X volume of binding buffer (100uL)

    
  * Added equal volume of 100% EtOH so that [EtOH] = 50% (200uL)



Followed remainder of protocol and eluted with 20uL of H2O. Samples were spec'd.

Results:

Assuming the NanoDrop readings are accurate (according to the Whole Transcriptome Kit, these may NOT be accurate), got yields of ~93ng for the RBC Control sample and ~132ng for the RBC poly1:C sample. Transferred 1.5uL of each sample to separate 0.5mL tubes for submission to the Bioanalyzer. These were stored @ -80C in the "Bioanalyzer Samples" box. The remainder of the samples were stored @ -80C in the "Samples from Other Researchers" box.
