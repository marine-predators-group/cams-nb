Samples were pelleted at 100g, 4C for 10mins. The supe was mostly removed, leaving ~50uL of supe above the pellets. RNA was isolated according to the TriReagent protocol from the following samples:

3226:




    
  * A7

    
  * A10

    
  * A15

    
  * A17

    
  * A20

    
  * A22

    
  * A26

    
  * 3326:

    
  * B1

    
  * B8

    
  * B10

    
  * B13

    
  * B14

    
  * B22

    
  * B26

    
  * B29



RNAs were resuspended in 10uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. They will be DNase treated.
