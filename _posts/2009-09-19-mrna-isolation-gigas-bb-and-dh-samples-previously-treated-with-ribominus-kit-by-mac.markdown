Was given ~0.5ug of each of these two RNA samples and processed them with Ambion's microPolyA Purist Kit according to protocol. After elution, the samples were EtOH precipitated @ -80C for 30mins, pelleted 30mins 16,000g for 30mins, 4C. Supe removed, RNA washed with 1mL 70% EtOH and spun 10mins 16,000g, 4C. Supe removed. Resusupended in 10uL of The RNA Storage Solution and gave back to Mac.
