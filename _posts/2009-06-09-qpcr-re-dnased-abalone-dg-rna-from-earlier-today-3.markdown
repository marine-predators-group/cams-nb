Done to verify removal of gDNA from RNA. Used H.crach_16s_syb_f/r primers. [PCR workup/plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090608-01.jpg).

Results: Still f'ing gDNA! I'm pretty convinced that this is indeed due to the Ambion kit I'm using being old. Got mixed up with a newer kit, but neither had dates. Mac is going to be running a qPCR later today on DNased RNA that used the other Ambion kit. I will wait until the results of her qPCR to proceed.
