This is a repeat of the qPCR from yesterday, but without the 16s and OmpW primer sets due to double peaks in melting curves yesterday. [Plate layout/qPCR workup is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090225-1.jpg).

Results: Similar to yesterday's results, the amplification looks a bit odd when viewing on a log scale. However, the linear scale curves look to be normal. Melting curves look good for all genes examined and there is not any detectable gDNA in the RNA samples. Excellent...
