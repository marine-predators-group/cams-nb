Extracted the PCR products from the [gel slices from 20151113](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2015/11/13/pcr-oly-rad-seq-prep-scale-pcr-2/) using the QIAQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Substituted MiniElute columns so that I could elute with a smaller volume than what is used in the QIAQuick standard protocol.

Samples were eluted with 20μL of Buffer EB.

Will quantify these libraries via qPCR.
