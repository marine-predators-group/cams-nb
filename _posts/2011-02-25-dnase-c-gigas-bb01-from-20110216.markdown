Used EtOH precipitated BB01 RNA from [20110216](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan+2011+-+March+2011#sjw20110216) and followed Ambion's "rigorous" protocol, utilizing a total of 2uL of DNAse. Briefly, samples were incubated @ 37C for 30mins, an additional 1uL of DNase was added to each sample, mixed and incubated for an additional 30mins @ 37C. After finishing protocol, samples were spec'd.

Results:

First reading had an air bubble and should be ignored. DNased RNA looks good, based on 260/280 ratios. As is usually the case for DNased RNA, the 260/230 ratios are on the low side. Will check DNased RNA for residual gDNA.
