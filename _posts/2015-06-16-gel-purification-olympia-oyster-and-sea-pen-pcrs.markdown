Purified DNA from the remaining PCR bands excised by Jake on [20150609](http://heareresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/6-9-2015-flanking-primer-trial-pcr.html) and [20150610](http://heareresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/6-10-2015-flanking-primer-pcr-pt-2.html), as well as Jonathan's sea pen PCRs from [20150604](http://genefish.wikispaces.com/Jonathan%27s+Notebook), using Ultrafree-DA spin columns (Millipore). Transferred gel pieces from storage tubes (1.5mL snap cap tubes) to spin columns. Spun 10,000g, 5mins @ RT. Transferred purified DNA back to original storage tubes. See the [sequence_log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV_gF766XZAcHljOFBWd3pLTUJwbUxkdkg1OGdCY3c&usp=sharing) (Google Sheet) for a full list of the samples and the sequencing plates layouts. Purified DNA was stored @ 4C O/N. Will prepare and submit plates for Sanger sequencing tomorrow.
