Noticed that Owl (Synology DS1812+ server) was beeping.

I also noticed, [just like the last time we had to replace a HDD in Owl](2015/07/31/server-hdd-failure-owl.html), that I didn't receive a notification email... As it turns out, this time the reason no notification email was received was due to the fact that I had changed my UW password and we use my UW account for authorizing usage of the UW email server through Owl. So, the emails Owl's been trying to send have failed because the authorization password was no longer valid... Yikes!

Anyway, I've updated the password on Owl for using the UW email servers and swapped out the bad drive with a backup drive we keep on hand for just such an occasion. [See the first post about this subject for a bit more detail on the process of swapping hard drives.](2015/07/31/server-hdd-failure-owl.html)



Unfortunately, the dead HDD is out of warranty, however we already have another backup drive on-hand.



Below are some screen caps of today's incident:

### Notice the empty slot in the graphical representation of the disk layout, as well as the "Available Slots" showing 1.

### After replacing the HDD (but before the system has rebuilt the new HDD), the empty slot is now represented as a green block and the "Available Slots" is now zero and "Unused Disks" is now 1.
