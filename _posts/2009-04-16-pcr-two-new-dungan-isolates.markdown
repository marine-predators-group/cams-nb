Repeat of yesterday's PCR, but with AmpliTaq, less gDNA and 50uL rxn volume. [PCR set up is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090416-01.jpg).

Gel loaded and run by Steven. Not entirely sure of the loading order. However, it doesn't really matter...

Results: Still absolutely nothing.



**UPDATE**: Noticed on 20090713 that the reactions didn't have dNTPs. Probably explains why it didn't work!
