According to the Bio-Rad rep that analyzed the calibration test on [20090824](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jun-Aug+2009#sjw20090824), recalibration might be a good idea. As such, we'll do that. Old calibration file was found and backed up prior to proceeding, as generation of a new calibration file would replace the old one.

Results: The Bio-Rad rep (Carl Fisher) has responded and said that the range of fluorescence is within the expected 2-fold difference and looks fine! Finally!
