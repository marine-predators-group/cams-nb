Repeated PCR from [20130919](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+July+-+December+2013#sjw20130919), but with a newly designed set of primers that targets the desired region of C1q for sequencing (SR IDs: 1553, 1554). Primers were designed in Geneious.

Results:

No amplification of any samples BS-treated or non-treated.
