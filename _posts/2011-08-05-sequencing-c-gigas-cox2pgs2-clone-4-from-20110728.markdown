Used new primers for sequencing (SR IDs: 1351 & 1352) clone #4. Sequenced clone two times in each direction. DNA and primers were sent for sequencing at ASU. Requested "High GC" treatment to help overcome the issue seen on 20110728.

Results:

Sequencing results received 20110810. Initial analysis suggests that we managed to fully sequence this clone! Will try to assemble a full-length CDS for COX2/PGS2.
