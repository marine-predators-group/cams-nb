The [previous attempt at this](2018/03/28/trimgalorefastqcmultiqc-illumina-hiseq-genome-sequencing-data.html) was interrupted by a random glitch with our [Mox HPC node](https://github.com/RobertsLab/hyak_mox/wiki).

I removed the last files processed by [TrimGalore!](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore), just in case they were incomplete. I updated the slurm script to process only the remaining files that had _not_ been processed when the Mox glitch happened (including the files I deemed "incomplete").

As in the initial run, I kept the option in TrimGalore! to automatically run FastQC on the trimmed output files.

TrimGalore! slurm script: [20180401_trim_galore_illumina_geoduck_hiseq_slurm.sh](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180328_trim_galore_illumina_hiseq_geoduck/20180401_trim_galore_illumina_geoduck_hiseq_slurm.sh)

MultiQC was run locally once the files were copied to Owl.



#### Results:



Job completed on 20180404.

Trimmed FASTQs: [20180328_trim_galore_illumina_hiseq_geoduck/](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180328_trim_galore_illumina_hiseq_geoduck/)

MD5 checksums: [20180328_trim_galore_illumina_hiseq_geoduck/checksums.md5](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180328_trim_galore_illumina_hiseq_geoduck/checksums.md5)





  * MD5 checksums were generated on Mox node and verified after copying to Owl.

Trimming completed and the FastQC results look much better than before.

Will proceed with full-blown assembly!
