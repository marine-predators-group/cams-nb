Need more PCR product for sequencing. Repeated reaction from 20110825.

Results:

Lane 1 - Hypperladder I (Bioline)

Lane 2 - PCR 1 & 2

Lane 3 - PCR 3 & 4

Lane 4 - PCR 5 & 6

Lane 5 - Neg. Control

Bands from lanes 2 - 4 were excised and purified with Ultra-free DA columns (Millipore) and spec'd. Concentration was extremely low (3.5ng/uL) and too dilute for sequencing. Will EtOH precipitate.
