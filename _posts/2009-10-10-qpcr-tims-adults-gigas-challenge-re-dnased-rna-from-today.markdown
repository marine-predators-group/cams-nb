Performed qPCR using q18s primers on re-DNased RNA (1:100 dilution to match final concentration of template after making cDNA). [qPCR set up and plate layout are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20091009-01.jpg).

gDNA dilutions were used as positive controls. gDNA = BB11 (0.49ug/uL) from [20090519](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090519). Used 5uL of 1:10, 1:100 and 1:000 dilutions.

Results: re-DNase-ing the samples seems to have worked. Positive controls are the only samples to come up. Will proceed to making cDNA.
