A subset of samples (4 samples from each group) were pooled (see [spreadsheet](https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AmS_90rPaQMzdE9lOE1YaWdwVm9RN0lPTG11S2E2V2c&hl=en), green-highlighted samples), each providing ~68ug of RNA. The pooled sample was split into two tubes (435uL/tube). 0.1 vols (43.5uL) of 3M NaOAC (pH=5.2) were added, then 2 vols of 100% EtOH (957uL). Tubes were vortexed and incubated @ -80C for 30mins. RNA was pelleted by spinning 16,000g, 30mins, 4C. Supe was removed, pellets washed with 70% EtOH. Tubes were spun 16,000, 10mins, 4C. Supe removed. Pellets were resuspended in 250uL of RNase-free H2O and stored @-80C until Monday for mRNA isolation.
