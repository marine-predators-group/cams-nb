I isolated DNA from [the _Crassotrea virginica_ gonad samples sent by Katie Lotterhos](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2017/10/03/samples-received-c-virginica-gonad-tissue-from-katie-lotterhos/) using the E.Z.N.A. Mollusc Kit with the following modifications:





  * Samples were homogenized with plastic, disposable pestle in 350μL of ML1 Buffer


  * No optional steps were used


  * Eluted each in 100μL of Elution Buffer and pooled into a single sample



NOTE: Sample 034 did not process properly (no phase separation after 24:1 chlorform:IAA addition - along with suggested additions of ML1 Buffer) and was discarded.

Quantified the DNA using the Qubit dsDNA BR Kit (Invitrogen). Used 2μL of DNA sample.

Samples were stored in the same box the tissue was delivered in and stored in the same location in our -80C: [rack 8, row 5, column 4](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qsvz3QTURlPF_hX05BQxjom3484WuMfqQ1ILl9LEljU/edit?usp=sharing).



#### Results:



Qubit (Google Sheet): [20171114_qubit_Cvirginica_gDNA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T5CzZH8p73UCDXNUhDK685FtfsNE4R9lRQa5ZZMuqW8/edit?usp=sharing)

Ample DNA in all samples for MBDseq. (Refer to "Original Sample Conc." column in spreadsheet.)

Will let Steven & Katie know.
