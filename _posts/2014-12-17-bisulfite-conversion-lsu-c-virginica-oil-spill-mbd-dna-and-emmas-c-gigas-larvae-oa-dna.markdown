Performed bisulfite conversion on MBD DNA samples from LSU C.virginica oil spill samples (see [201411202](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+August+-+December+2014#sjw20141202) and [20141126](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+August+-+December+2014#sjw20141126)) and Emma's C.gigas larvae OA DNA samples (see 20141121) with the Methylamp DNA Modification Kit (Epigentek).

Added 4uL of H2O to each of Emma's DNA samples to bring them up to 24uL.

Samples were processed according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Samples were eluted with 10uL of Solution R6 and stored @ -20C.
