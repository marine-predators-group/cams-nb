I transferred 8ug (136uL) of _Crassotrea virginica_ gDNA ([isolated earlier today](2017/12/11/dna-isolation-quantification-crassotrea-virginica-mantle-gdna.html)) to two separate 1.7mL snap cap tubes for sonication/shearing.

I performed shearing at the [NOAA Northwest Fisheries Science Center](https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/about/facilities/montlake.cfm), using the Qsonica Q800R. Mackenzie Gavery assisted me.

Target fragment size was ~500bp.

Samples were run at the same time with the following settings:





  * 10 minutes


  * 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off


  * 25% power

After sonication, fragmentation was assessed using the Seeb Lab's Bioanlyzer 2100 (Agilent) and the DNA 12000 Chip Kit (Agilent). NOTE: All of the reagents and the chips were past their expiration dates (most in June 2016).

Results:

Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Expert file (XAD): [2100 expert_DNA 12000_DE72902486_2017-12-11_13-45-31.xad](https://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/2100%20expert_DNA%2012000_DE72902486_2017-12-11_13-45-31.xad)

Fragmentation was successful, and pretty consistent.

Both samples appear to have an average fragment size of ~420bp. Will proceed with MeDIP, once reagents are received.
