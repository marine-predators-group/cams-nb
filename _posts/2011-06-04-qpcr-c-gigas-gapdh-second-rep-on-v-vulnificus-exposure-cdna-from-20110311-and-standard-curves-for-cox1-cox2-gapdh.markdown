Ran a qPCR on all cDNA samples. Created a standard curve to possibly allow for use of the BioRad software for gene expression analysis. Standard curve was created from pooled cDNA (1uL from each individual sample). [Master mix calcs are here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20110602-01.jpg).

Standard curves aren't that good. Will not use them. Will analyze data using PCR Miner.
