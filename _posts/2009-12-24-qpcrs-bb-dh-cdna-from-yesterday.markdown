qPCR was set up on these cDNAs using the following primers:

EW778094 ("Ficolin 3") -

AJ422120.p.cg.6 ("MDR49", "Multidrug resistance protein homolog 49") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.

Preliminary results show that the EW778094 primer set looks bad; bad fluorescence profile and poor melt curves. Primers may require optimization.





qPCR was set up on these cDNAs using the following primers:

AM855874.p.cg.6 ("CP17A", "Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.

AM857078.p.cg.6 ("C1QT4", Complement C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein 4") - This was upregulated in DH SOLiD data.
