RNA was isolated from hard clam gill (0.08g; from [20090109](/Sam%27s+Notebook#sjw20090109)) and from hard clam hemos (from [20090114](/Sam%27s+Notebook#sjw20090114)). One "unknown" sample (from 20090114) was also processed. Pellets were resuspended in 50uL of 0.1%DEPC-H2O. Hemo samples were pooled. Samples were spec'd.

Results: 260/280 looks OK for hemos. The gill sample has excellent 260/280 and pretty good 260/230. Samples will be reprecipitated over the weekend @ -20C according to [Ambion PolyA Purist protocol](http://aquacul4.fish.washington.edu/Protocols:Information%20Sheets/Commercial%20Protocols:Manuals/Ambion%20-%20MicroPoly%28A%29Purist%20Kit.pdf) in preparation for mRNA isolation.
