  * Complete Olympia oyster GBS data analysis - Progress has actually been made! After many struggles, I managed to get a PyRad analysis of the entire data set to complete. Now, I just have to figure out what to do with the output files...

    
  * Troubleshoot Stacks analysis of Olympia oyster GBS data analysis - After switching computing to Amazon AWS, I thought this would be a breeze. However, the analysis keeps failing (without errors) on the "ustacks" portion of the pipeline; no output files are created even though the analysis runs (after 20hrs!!). Although it would be nice to get Stacks to complete successfully (just once!), now that I have a completed set of analysis from PyRad, troubleshooting this will be a little lower on the priority list.

    
  * Start using Hyak - We need computing power and Hyak is a free resource. Although Amazon AWS is pretty sweet , it ends up being a bit costly...
