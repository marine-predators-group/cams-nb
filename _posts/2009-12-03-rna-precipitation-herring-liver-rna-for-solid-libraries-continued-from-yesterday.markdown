#### RNA Precipitation



Samples were pelleted for 30mins, 16,000g @ 4C. Supe was discarded, samples quick spun, residual supe removed and then washed with 1mL 70% EtOH. Tubes were vortexed until pellet came off of bottom of tube and then spun 15mins, 16,000g @ 4C. Supe was discarded, samples quick spun, residual supe removed and then resuspended in 250uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O in preparation for mRNA isolation using the Ambion Micro PolyA Purist Kit.





#### mRNA Isolation



Clean RNA from earlier today was processed according to the Ambion Micro PolyA Purist Kit to isolate mRNA. This procedure was done two times to ensure full mRNA enrichment of the samples. Samples were then spec'd.

Results:

Yields:

3L - 10.66 ng/uL x 200uL = 2.132ug

6L - 6.97 ng/uL x 200uL = 1.394ug

2L - 10.89 ng/uL x 200uL = 2.178ug

4L - 6.43 ng/uL x 200uL = 1.286ug





#### mRNA Precipitation



Precipitation of mRNA from earlier today in preparation for fragmentation. Fragmentation requires mRNA volumes of <8uL, so after precipitation I will resuspend pellets in 8uL of 0.1% DEPC-H2O. Will use 1ug (this means 1/2 of 3L and 2L & all of 6L and 4L) of mRNA from each sample for precipitation. Remainder of 3L and 2L samples were stored @ -80C in "Herring RNA Box #1."Samples were precipitated by adding 0.1 volumes 5M ammonium acetate, 1uL glycogen and 2 volumes of 100% EtOH. Samples were incubated O/N @ -20C.
