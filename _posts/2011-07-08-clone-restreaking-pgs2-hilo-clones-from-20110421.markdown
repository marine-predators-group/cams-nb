Sequencing of the PGS2/COX2 clone failed (was empty vector). Restreaked bacterial clones on to a Kan50 plate (made 20110413 by SJW) from a plate that Caroline Storer had created from cloning colony selection on 20110421. Samples were labeled as PGS Lo 1 & 2 and PGS Hi 3 & 4. Additionally, there were red numbers on the plate associated with these four samples. They were 42 - 45, respectively. PGS Hi 4 (#45) was previously grown up and sequenced. This sample is what produced vector only sequence. Incubated O/N @ 37C. Hopefully we'll bacteria is still viable and will have samples to grow up for miniprep, plamsid iso and sequencing.

Results:

Limited growth in all after O/N incubation. Will leave plate on bench over the weekend and hope to get more growth.

After the weekend on the bench, have growth in all but PGS Lo 2. Will inoculate liquid cultures for plasmid preps.
