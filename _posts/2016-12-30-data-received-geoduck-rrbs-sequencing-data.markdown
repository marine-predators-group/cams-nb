Hollie Putnam prepared some reduced representation bisulfite Illumina libraries and had them sequenced by Genewiz.

The data was downloaded and MD5 checksums were generated.

IMPORTANT: MD5 checksums have not yet been provided by Genewiz! We cannot verify the integrity of these data files at this time! Checksums have been requested. Will create new notebook entry (and add link to said entry) once the checksums have been received and we can compare them.

UPDATE 20161230 - [Have received and verified checksums.](2016/12/30/data-management-geoduck-rrbs-data-integrity-verification.html)
