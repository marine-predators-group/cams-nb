I quantified the three samples (listed below) that [I SpeedVac'd yesterday](2017/05/10/dna-concentration-acropora-cervicornis-staghorn-coral-dna-from-javier-casariego-fiu.html) using the the Roberts Lab Qubit 3.0.




    
  * 2h Block 1

    
  * 2h Block 8

    
  * D35 Block 8



Quantification was performed using the dsDNA Broad Range Kit.

Used 1uL of each sample.

Results:

One sample (2h Block 1) is still slightly too dilute in order to use the _recommended_ total amount of DNA for the methylation assay (100ng), but still falls well within the recommended range for the assay. Will proceed with the methylation assay for all samples.

Values were added to the spreadsheet provided by Javier (Google Sheet): [A.cervicornis_DNA_Extractions(May_2017).xlsx](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOZI7LkzBx6tm0RsQQicRNOCKMf83wZb4CMWcdukXgQ/edit?usp=sharing)
