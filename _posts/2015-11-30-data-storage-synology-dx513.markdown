Running a bit low on storage on Owl (Synology DS1812+) and we will be receiving a ton of data in the next few months, so we purchased a Synology DX513. It's an expansion unit designed specifically for seamlessly expanding our existing storage volume on Owl.

Installed 5 x 8TB Seagate HDDs and connected to Owl with the supplied eSATA cable.

Now, we just need to wait (possibly days) for the full expansion to be completed.
