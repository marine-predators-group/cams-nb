[qPCR set up/plate layout is here](http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Arabidopsis/Notebook%20Workup%20Files/20090612-01.jpg). Used Cv_18s_F/R primers for the MV hemocyte RNA and Gigas_18s_F/R primers for the Turbo kit test. Anneal 55C.

Results: DNase treatment worked on all but the following samples: B23, B14, A21. However, these three samples were slightly below the initial, background fluorescence in each sample. The Turbo kit test indicates that all three kits are working perfectly and all can/should be used with confidence for treating samples.
