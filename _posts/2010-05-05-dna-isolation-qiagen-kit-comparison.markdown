Someone had noticed that gDNA isolated using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit we rec'd in April 2010 seemed to be yielding degraded DNA.

The two samples used for the comparison were a single tail (split in two equal weight pieces) from a juvenile salmon that was snap frozen, without preservatives, at the time of its collection. The samples were prepped. 0.5ug of eluted DNA was then run on a 1.2% agarose-TAE gel containing 0.1ug/mL of ethidium bromide. 5uL of [Bioline's Hyperladder I](https://www.bioline.com/h_prod_detail.asp?itemid=153) was loaded for size assessment (see link for marker layout).

Results:

Clearly, there's significant quality difference! A free replacement kit was sent by Qiagen.
