[Previously took the analysis just through the mapping](http://onsnetwork.org/kubu4/2018/05/08/bs-seq-mapping-olympia-oyster-bisulfite-sequencing-trimgalore-fastqc-bismark/), but didn't realize [Steven wanted me to fully process the data](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/225#issuecomment-390408604).

So, as en exercise, I followed through with deduplication and sorting of the BAM files.

Then, ran a quick analysis using MethylKit in R. The analysis simply copied what [Steven had done with another data set](https://sr320.github.io/MethylKittens/) and I haven't examined it very thoroughly, so am not well-versed on what it's doing and/or why.

Jupyter Notebook (GitHub):





  * [20180530_emu_oly_methylation_mapping_deduplication.ipynb](https://github.com/sr320/LabDocs/blob/master/jupyter_nbs/sam/20180530_emu_oly_methylation_mapping_deduplication.ipynb)



R Studio Project (download the folder, load project in R Studio, and then run the script in the scripts subdirectory to run the analysis):



  * [20180531_oly_methylkit/](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/Athaliana/20180531_oly_methylkit/)



Will take the full data sets through this whole pipeline.
