Followed the rigorous protocol for Ambion's Turbo DNA-free protocol for the following RNAs:

BB#11-20

DH#11-20

Used 10ug of RNA (200ng/uL) in 50uL as directed. Here are the calcs for FF and DH.

Followed standard protocol on DNased samples from [20090508](/Sam%27s+Working+Notebook+Jan-May+2009#sjw20090508):

BB#1-10

DH#1-10

The standard protocol should be fine for these samples, since the procedure worked on Friday for some of them.
