Check the initial data binning:

```shell
anvi-interactive \
--profile-db PROFILE.db \
--contigs-db contigs.db \
--collection-name CONCOCT
```

That generates this:

![initial anvio dendrogram screencap](https://github.com/RobertsLab/sams-notebook/blob/master/images/screencaps/20190619_anvio_initial_dendrogram.png?raw=true)



Table representation of initial data binning:

```shell
anvi-summarize \
--pan-or-profile-db PROFILE.db \
--contigs-db contigs.db \
--collection-name CONCOCT \
--output-dir MERGED_SUMMARY
```

This command generates an `index.html` file (see Results section below for link) and takes ~10 minutes to complete. Here's the portion showing the binning completion/redundancy info (there's much, much more data present in that file):

Refine the bins:

```shell
anvi-refine \
--profile-db PROFILE.db \
--contigs-db contigs.db \
--collection-name CONCOCT \
--bin-id Bin_75
```

In the screencap below, the region of the dendrogram marked as "Bin_75_1" shows a drastic difference in coverage in the MG7 track at this particular split. Additionally, looking at the quick stats shown for this newly identified bin (in the window pane to the left), one can see that Completion is now 99% and Redundancy is only 1.4%; a marked improvement on the automatic binning.

There does appear to be a problem with the binning data, though. It appears that many bins exhibit Completion/Redundancy data of 0.00%, however clicking on that data in the summary table reveals that is incorrect:

Here's an example of what happens when refining Bin 3:

Ah, as it turns out, this has been fixed in the "master" commit in Anvi'o (thanks to the Anvi'o devs for their fast responses to my questions on their [Slack channel](https://anvio.slack.com/archives/C8SFMGYF3/p1561043792054900)!!).

Here's how the upgrade process went.

Clone current version of Anvio's GitHub repo:

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/merenlab/anvio.git
```
---

Create an Anaconda environment for Anvio', using Python version 3.6.

Then, activate the newly created Anaconda environment.

Within the cloned Anvi'o repo, use Python to execute the `setup.py` file.

Finally, use `pip` to complete the Anvi'o installation.

```shell
conda create --yes --name anvio python=3.6

conda activate anvio

python setup.py

pip install --editable
```

---

Now, we should be able to run `anvio-interactive` on the database again and get an updated version of stats for each bin:

```shell
conda activate anvio
(anvio) sam@swoose:~/analyses/20190619_anvio$ ~/programs/anvio_git_master_bfbcbb3/bin/anvi-interactive --profile-db PROFILE.db --contigs-db contigs.db --collection-name CONCOCT


Config Error: The database at 'contigs.db' is outdated (its version is v12, but your anvi'o
              installation only knows how to deal with v13). You can migrate your database
              without losing any data using the program `anvi-migrate-db`.  
```

So, I ran the `anvi-migrate-db` command as recommended:

`~/programs/anvio_git_master_bfbcbb3/bin/anvi-migrate-db contigs.db`

This message popped up:

```shell
* The contigs database is now 13. Unfortunatly this update removed all single-copy
core gene HMMs from your contigs database :( We are very sorry about this, but
we only did it to be able to offer you nicer things. It is best if you re-run
`anvi-run-hmms` program from scratch. Doing that will not remove any 'non-
default' HMM profiles you may have added in this contigs database, so you have
nothing to worry about.
```

So, I ran the `anvi-run-hmms` command on the database to complete the upgrae process:

`~/programs/anvio_git_master_bfbcbb3/bin/anvi-run-hmms -c contigs.db --num-threads 23`

---

After upgrading, here's how things look:

Additionally, the Anvi'o refine interface provides an informative pop up when clicking on the Completion info on the left pane that explains in user-friendly lingo what your Completion/Redundancy data might suggest:

Clearly, there's a _lot_ of manual binning that needs to take place in order to refine the bins with excessive Completion/Redundancy info...
