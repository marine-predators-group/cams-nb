_Crassostrea virginica_ mantle gDNA that had previously been [isolated on 20181114](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/11/14/DNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-DNA.html) was evaluated for integrity via agaroase gel [yesterday (20190305)](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/05/Agarose-Gel-Lotterhos-C.virginica-Mantle-DNA-from-20181114.html). Everything looked pretty good, so proceeded with shearing in preparation for MBD enrichment.

Aliquoted 2500ng of DNA in a final volume of 100uL of each sample in 0.5mL snap cap (polypropylene) tubes for shearing in the Seeb Lab sonicator (Diagenode Bioruptor 300) with the following settings:

- 30 cycles

- 30 seconds on

- 30 seconds off

Calculations for DNA dilutions are here (Google Sheet):

Ideally, this will shear DNA to a target size around 300bp.

After shearing, ran all samples on the Bionalyzer 2100 (Agilent) using a DNA 12000 chip according to manufacturer's protocol.
