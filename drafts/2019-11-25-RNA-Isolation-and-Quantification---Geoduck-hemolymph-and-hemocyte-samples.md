[Shelly asked me to isolate RNA](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/763) and run some qPCRs on the following samples:

I was unable to find the 11/01 and the 11/15 samples.

RNA was isolated using the Quick-DNA/RNA Microprep Plus Kit (ZymoResearch) according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the following notes/changes:

- Added four volumes of lysis buffer for the hemolymph samples

- Elution volume = 15uL

After processing, samples were quantified using the Qubit hsRNA Assay, using 2uL of sample. Due to high sample concentrations (i.e. >100ng/uL) I had to dilute the samples a couple of times and re-measure.

#### RESULTS

Here are the three sets of raw data (Google Sheets):

Here's the summary table of sample concentrations:
