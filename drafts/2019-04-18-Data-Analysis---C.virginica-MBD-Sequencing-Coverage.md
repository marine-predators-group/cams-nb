A while ago, Steven tasked me with assessing some questions related to the sequencing coverage we get doing MBD-BSseq in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/609). At the heart of it all was really to try to get an idea of how much usable data we actually get when we do an MBD-BSseq project. Yaamini happened to have done an MBD-BSseq project relatively recently, and it's one she's actively working on analyzing, so we went with that data set.

Data was initially trimmed:

- [20180411 TrimGalore and FastQC](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2018/04/11/trimgalorefastqcmultiqc-trim-10bp-53-ends-c-virginica-mbd-bs-seq-fastq-data.html)

Subsequently, the data was concatenated, subset, and aligned using Bismark:

- [20190313 Bismark alignment subsetting](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/03/13/Methylation-Analysis-C.virginica-Gonad-MBD-with-Varying-Read-Subsets-with-Bismark-on-Mox.html)


Today, I finally found the time to dedicate to evaluating alignment coverage of each of the Bismark sequence subsets. It was done in a Jupyter Notebook and solely with Bash/Python! I used this as project as an excuse to dive into using Python a bit more, instead of using R. For what I needed to accomplish, I just felt like this approach was simpler (instead of creating an R project and all of that).

#### RESULTS

Plot of the various "Percent Methylation" coverages in each of the Bismark subsets. The lines/bars are redundant. I added the lines to provide a better visual guide to see how the percent methylation coverage changes from one Bismark subset to the next. A quick guide to X axis labeling:

- half_avg_reads: Subset of 50% of the average number of read pairs.

- avg_reads: Subset of the average number of read pairs.

- half_total_reads: Subset of 50% of the total number of read pairs.

- total_reads: All read pairs.
