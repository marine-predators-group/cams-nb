Performed reverse transcription on the [DNased hemolymph and hemocyte RNA from yesterday](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/11/25/RNA-Isolation-and-Quantification-Geoduck-hemolymph-and-hemocyte-samples.html).

Reverse transcription was performed using 100ng of each sample with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase from Promega.

Briefly, 100ng of DNased RNA was combined with 1:10 dilution of oligo dT primers (Promega) and brought up to a final volume of 15uL in standard 0.5mL snap cap tubes. Tubes were incubated for 10mins at 70<sup>o</sup>C in a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research), using a heated lid. Samples were immediately placed on ice.

A master mix of buffer, dNTPs, water, and M-MLV reverse transcriptase was made, 10uL of the master mix was added to each sample, and mixed via finger flicking. Samples were incubated for 1hr at 42<sup>o</sup>C in a PTC-200 thermal cycler (MJ Research), using a heated lid, followed by a 5min incubation at 65<sup>o</sup>C.
