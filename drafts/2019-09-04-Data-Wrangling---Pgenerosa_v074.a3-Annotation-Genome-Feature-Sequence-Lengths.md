The [GenSAS Pgenerosa_v074 annotation from 20190710](https://robertslab.github.io/sams-notebook/2019/07/10/Genome-Annotation-Pgenerosa_v074-Using-GenSAS.html) (referred to as: Panopea-generosa-vv0.74.a3) recently completed (after nearly a month of running).

In preparation for a paper we're writing, we needed some summary stats for Panopea-generosa-vv0.74.a3. This info will be compiled in to a table for the manuscript. See our Genomic Resources wiki for more info on GFFs:

- [Genomic Resources Wiki](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/wiki/Genomic-Resources) (GitHub)

Calculations were performed using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

#### RESULTS

I've copied/pasted (and, reordered) the summary data for each of the GFFs that were analyzed, for quick reference. Will get this compiled in to a table of some sort for people to use for the manuscript.
